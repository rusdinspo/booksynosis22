<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Monarchs in a Changing World: Biology and Conservation of an Iconic Butterfly</h2><p><p>Monarch butterflies are among the most popular insect species in the world and are an icon for conservation groups and environmental education programs. Monarch caterpillars and adults are easily recognizable as welcome visitors to gardens in North America and beyond, and their spectacular migration in eastern North America (from breeding locations in Canada and the United States to overwintering sites in Mexico) has captured the imagination of the public. </p><p>Monarch migration, behavior, and chemical ecology have been studied for decades. Yet many aspects of monarch biology have come to light in only the past few years. These aspects include questions regarding large-scale trends in monarch population sizes, monarch interactions with pathogens and insect predators, and monarch molecular genetics and large-scale evolution. A growing number of current research findings build on the observations of citizen scientists, who monitor monarch migration, reproduction, survival, and disease. Monarchs face new threats from humans as they navigate a changing landscape marked by deforestation, pesticides, genetically modified crops, and a changing climate, all of which place the future of monarchs and their amazing migration in peril. </p><p>To meet the demand for a timely synthesis of monarch biology, conservation and outreach, <i>Monarchs in a Changing World</i> summarizes recent developments in scientific research, highlights challenges and responses to threats to monarch conservation, and showcases the many ways that monarchs are used in citizen science programs, outreach, and education. It examines issues pertaining to the eastern and western North American migratory populations, as well as to monarchs in South America, the Pacific and Caribbean Islands, and Europe. The target audience includes entomologists, population biologists, conservation policymakers, and K&#x2013;12 teachers.</p></p><p><p>Karen S.

Now that the rule is over--at least for the moment--historians are beginning the process of placing the experience into its political, social and global contexts. Martin Malia, a former history professor at the University of California, Berkeley, has contributed mightily to that process with this comprehensive look at the entire period of socialist rule, from its origins to the roots of its collapse. He leaves no conceptual stone unturned, providing lively insights to ideas and ideologies while offering a complete summary of the complex history.Analyzing Western Sovietology as much as critiquing the Communist regime, Malia surveys the artificial support lent to the "ideocratic partocracy" that was the Soviet Union. He takes aim at the concepts--both Leninists' political justifications and academic apologias--undergirding the forced creation of the classless society. As its tortured, now completed history proves, the Soviet Union never lacked academic explicators of the supposed deformations of its planned form. After World War II, the expanding social sciences came up with alternative models of Soviet development in order to refute the influential totalitarian one; among these were modernization theories, bureaucratic and interest group politics, and Marxist sociology. Among historians, admiring biographies such as Stephen Cohen's of Bukharin and Isaac Deutscher's of Trotsky implied that, to invigorate itself, Communism need only get back to the humane basics of the New Economic Policy (NEP) of the 1920s. Malia rejects such views as he reviews Sovietism's course, its Marxist foundation, the quandary its leaders faced when the proletarian revolution failed (initially) to spread abroad, and the zigzag reforms this failure necessitated, of which the NEP was merely the first attempt, Gorbachevism the futility-filled last. A trenchant summary that leaves no conceptual issue untouched. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>One Skein: 30 Quick Projects to Knit or Crochet</h2><p><p>These knitted and crocheted fashion accessories and decorative accents for the home vary in their required levels of skill, but all can be completed quickly and require only one skein of yarn. The stitch patterns and clear instructions make it easy for even procrastinators and the less-than-diligent to create a ruffled cravat, a drawstring bag, a tank top, cozy scarves, arm and leg warmers, lace wristlets, fingerless gloves, a mohair pillow, and even a sweater for a baby. Several projects do not require any new yarn at all&#x2015;instead projects such as the Felted Striped Tote or the Labyrinth Circle Rug are designed using up a skein's worth of leftovers from other projects.

Despite high risks, Katya and Misha had spoken against the government. The children, alone and desperate, fear the worst. Will they ever see their parents again?</p><p>But all it takes is one crumpled letter to give Marya and Georgi hope and send them on a dangerous mission to reunite their family. They must steal away in the dark of night, escape the city, and find passage to the great Siberian wilderness. And even then, if they succeed in getting away, their journey will have only just begun.</p><p>In this companion novel to her breathtaking Russian epic <em>Angel on the Square,</em> National Book Award winning author Gloria Whelan takes readers on a remarkable journey that is both perilous and transforming.</p></p><p><p>Gloria Whelan is the bestselling author of many novels for young readers, including <em>Homeless Bird</em>, winner of the National Book Award; <em>Fruitlands: Louisa May Alcott Made Perfect</em>; <em>Angel on the Square</em>; <em>Burying the Sun</em>; <em>Once on This Island</em>, winner of the Great Lakes Book Award; and <em>Return to the Island</em>. She lives in the woods of northern Michigan.</p>Grade 5-8-A story of a remarkable 13-year-old girl in an extraordinary situation. In Leningrad, in 1934, Marya sets out to find her parents, former aristocrats and therefore considered enemies of the state, who have been sent to Siberia as political prisoners. The spirited and resourceful girl learns that her mother is in Dudinka, a thousand miles from the closest railway station. Marya obtains a few rubles selling her paintings (like Kobe in Homeless Bird [HarperCollins, 2000], Marya's creativity helps sustain her) and buys tickets for herself and her younger brother. At the railway station, the children begin their trek, finding their way by following a river. Some strangers help them; others conspire to report them to the authorities for placement in an orphanage. A tribe of reindeer-herding Samoyeds helps the children to their final stop, where they are reunited with their mother. Papa, who had been sent to a coal-mining camp in Siberia, eventually joins them, but is so ill that he dies at the first signs of spring. Life under Stalin as seen through the eyes of Marya is accessible, well researched, and culturally insightful. Lyrical prose conveys both a strong sense of place and the tremendous love that compels the protagonist to find her parents. Once again, Whelan successfully explores territory less traveled in books for young people.<br><i>Connie Tyrrell Burns, Mahoney Middle School, South Portland, ME</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Garden in Paris</h2><p>&#34;The motto, &#39;It is never too late to be what you might have been,&#39; haunts Mary Davis. Newly widowed, she has the notion that if she can return to Paris with her increasingly distant daughter, perhaps she&#39;ll be able to reconcile with the past and find a new future&#34;--Provided by publisher.</p><p>Stephanie Grace Whitson is the author of twelve novels, including Secrets on the Wind, and a two-time Christy Award finalist. She pursues a full-time writing and speaking career from her home studio in Lincoln, Nebraska.PROLOGUE <p>November 2003 Omaha, Nebraska </p><p>The only problem with her life, Mary thought, was that she didn't have one. Sam had been gone for two years, but she was still playing by his rules. The weight of the charade was too much. She would take the pills. </p><p>The nurse and the sheriff had accounted for every prescription medication the day Sam died. They'd taken the Oxycontin and hundreds of dollars worth of other pharmaceuticals off to be destroyed. Except for the sleeping pills. The hospice nurse had trusted Mary with those. Had even urged her to make use of them until she could see her own doctor. Had she looked in the bottle, the nurse would have had second thoughts. Mary had been collecting pills for a long time. She knew enough about computers to Ask Jeeves and follow a few links until she was convinced, even taking into account reduced potency, that she had enough to do the trick painlessly. </p><p>She hadn't expected her hand to tremble so when she opened the bottle. She hadn't expected to spill the water from the glass on her bedside table. As the water trickled across the tabletop and dripped onto the sculptured carpet below, Mary pondered the realization that, while she wanted to think she was the kind of person St. Peter would be glad to see in line at the pearly gates, when it came right down to it, she had no real assurance as to what might be on the other side of what Sam had irreverently called "the dirt nap." She put the lid back on the bottle of pills, tucked it under the bank of pillows propped up against the headboard, and leaned back. Staring up at the ceiling she scolded herself. Mary Elisabeth McKibbin Davis, you're fifty years old. You have no life of your own, no future plans, and no guts to do anything about it. No wonder Sam spelled Elizabeth with a z instead of an s. No wonder he named your daughter after his mother. Elizabeth Davis had a spine. Mary Elisabeth McKibbin has none. Elizabeth Davis went to market.... Mary Elisabeth McKibbin stayed home. She fell asleep repeating her bittersweet version of the old nursery rhyme. </p><p>By the next evening, Mary was grateful she had put the pills away. Earlier that afternoon, she had wandered into a store and found a cheap little piece of junk with a motto that offered hope. She couldn't get it out of her mind. And then there was that magazine cover, featuring the Sea Cloud slicing through the water, her sails unfurled against a brilliant blue sky. Reading the article, Mary had learned that the ship's home port was a small town in Southern France called Arcachon. Her heart pounded as she reread the article, searching for the captain's name. </p><p>Instead of taking the pills... she wrote a letter. </p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Excerpted from: A Garden in Paris by Stephanie Grace Whitson Copyright � 2005; ISBN 0764229354 Published by Bethany House Publishers Unauthorized duplication prohibited.</p></p><h2>Vineyard Enigma: A Martha&#39;s Vineyard Mystery</h2><p>Meeting the mysterious Mahsimba, who is searching for two priceless soapstone figures missing from his African homeland, J.W. Jackson becomes alarmed when his wife, Zee, becomes infatuated with the stranger, whose search pits him against powerful and dangerous forces in Martha&#39;s Vineyard&#39;s art world. 25,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Philip R. Craig</b> grew up on a small cattle ranch near Durango, Colorado, before going off to college at Boston University, where he was an all-American fencer. He earned his M.F.A. at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop, where Vance Bourjaily was his adviser. A professor emeritus of English at Wheelock College in Boston, he now lives year-round on Martha's Vineyard with his wife, Shirley. <i>Vineyard Enigma</i> is the thirteenth book in the Vineyard series. Other titles include <i>Vineyard Shadows, Vineyard Blues, A Fatal Vineyard Season, A Shoot on Martha's Vineyard,</i> and <i>A Deadly Vineyard Holiday.</i><p><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> Later I figured I got involved, and almost killed, for three reasons: the money, the case itself, and Zee's uncharacteristic detachment from the world we shared. </p><p> If you live on Martha's Vineyard you can always use more money, and the job interested me because it concerned works of art whose history caught my fancy. Most of all, though, I probably agreed to work for Mahsimba because, during an especially warm and lovely spring, Zee had become curiously spellbound and ethereal, like a teenaged girl. </p><p> Her dreaminess had continued on into June and had disconnected her from our normal family life. She was as efficient as ever at her work in the emergency room at the hospital, but she seemed lost in obscure thoughts when at home with the children and me, as though she were seeing the world with the eyes of one who had once been blind. </p><p> I had several thoughts about the cause of this, none having anything to do with the others. Perhaps she had relapsed into guilt over killing a Boston thug the year before, even though she'd done it to save herself and our daughter and had taken a gunshot in the process. Or maybe it was a sort of sustained spring fever. Or maybe she was experiencing some form of the seven-year itch. That wouldn't be too surprising, considering my own certainty of my limitations as a husband. But when I asked her the cause of her sea change, she only pressed her forefinger to my lips and wordlessly shook her head. </p><p> Whatever the cause of her enchantment, there seemed to be nothing I could do about it, so I determined to remain unchanged myself, to stay the man whose love had once given her joy, and to hope that it still did or would again, however dreamily removed from me she seemed to be for the nonce. When Mahsimba came into my life I was glad to accept a job that would oblige me to think of something else. </p><p> Before the phone rang, I was alone in the house. Zee was at work, the kids were in school, and the cats were off catting somewhere outside. I was finishing my morning coffee and reading the <i>Vineyard Gazette's</i> sixth-months-later story about the Headless Horseman. </p><p> That still-unidentified body had long since been placed in some mainland morgue or grave, but on the Vineyard its notoriety had lessened only slightly since the previous December, when an understandably shocked pony rider had discovered it beside a frosty bridle path up in West Tisbury. The equestrian connection explained half of the corpse's nickname, and its missing head accounted for the other half. It could have been called the Handless Horseman, for that matter, because the hands were missing, too, along with the corpse's clothes. </p><p> Naked, headless, and handless corpses are not common on Martha's Vineyard, especially in the dead of winter, so locally the discovery had caused quite a stir. Speculation swirled about who had died and why and who had done the deed, and there was much conjecture that someone with a horse was involved since that was clearly how the body had been transported along the trail. Unfortunately for the police, there are many horses and riders on the island and not one of them seemed the type to kill and behead people. </p><p> The how was easier; the man, white and in his forties, according to medical reports, had been shot right in the pump with what appeared to be a .38- or .40-caliber bullet. Before this happened, he had apparently been in good physical condition, but that was about all anyone had learned about him. He didn't fit any of the missing person reports that the police had received, and now, half a year later, he was as unknown as ever. </p><p> The <i>Gazette</i> report, consistent with that famous newspaper's policy of not emphasizing the island's darker side, was short and on a middle page, and contented itself with a brief review of the facts and of the questions that people still talked about: Who was the guy and who had killed him and why? </p><p> These questions continued to bother those of the island's citizens who didn't like the idea that they might be sharing their beloved Vineyard with a killer. I, however, was not one of the worriers, because it had been a long time since I'd thought that my island home actually was akin to Eden before the Fall. My Vineyard, for all its fabled loveliness, had its share of snakes living under the rocks. </p><p> But I had not moved to the island to get involved with such creatures. I had done enough of that during five years on the Boston PD. The bullet I still carried next to my spine as a consequence of wearing a shield had only been the last factor that led me to decide to let somebody else save the world. I had better things to do. </p><p> That very day, for example, I had veggie and flower gardens to tend, floors to vacuum, supper to prepare, a leak in my waders that I had to find and patch, another leak in the ceiling of the porch that I had to track down and fix, clothes to wash, shopping to do, and, most important, fishing to attend to. For the bluefish had been in for a couple of weeks, and I still had more of them to catch. </p><p> Ordinarily I could think of little that was more pleasurable than being on the beach doing battle with the blues, and this year fishing was doubly appealing because it also served to distract me from fretting about Zee. </p><p> I was just beginning to fret some more when Stanley Crandel phoned. </p><p> "J.W., that you?" </p><p> "Stanley, where are you? Up at the house?" </p><p> "No. London. Just got here from Africa. Went from Cape Town to Cairo. Terrific trip! That's what I'm calling about. Met this man in Harare. Interesting fellow. Seems he's going to the Vineyard. I wonder if you'll show him around, help him out." </p><p> "When's he coming?" </p><p> "He may be there already. I put him in touch with John Skye, and he'll be staying at John's place because Betsy and I won't get down to our place until later." </p><p> "What's he need me for?" </p><p> "It's a long story, and this call's costing me a fortune. He'll explain it when he sees you. Will you meet him?" </p><p> "Well..." </p><p> "You'll be doing me a favor." </p><p> I hate it when people say that. "All right," I said. </p><p> "I knew I could depend on you, J.W. I told him to call you from John's house when he gets in. His name's Mahsimba. Thanks. Gotta go." </p><p> The phone clicked and buzzed in my ear. </p><p> I shook my head at the thought of a phone call being too expensive for Stanley Crandel to bear. Stanley and his wife, Betsy, owned one of the biggest houses on East Chop, where Crandels had been summering for a hundred years. Stanley liked to think that he was a descendant of John Saunders, the onetime Virginia slave who, some said, was later the first Methodist preacher on the Vineyard. But it had been a long time since Stanley's line of Crandels had been slaves to anything but high finance. </p><p> This fact notwithstanding, it was typical of Stanley and Betsy simultaneously to be generous to friends, family, and charities, and yet to squeeze their pennies till they screamed. Maybe they had so many pennies precisely because they pinched them so hard. Maybe that was true of all wealthy people, including the other aristocratic and upper-middle-class African-American citizens of Oak Bluffs. I wouldn't know, being an outsider to such social circles. </p><p> I knew Stanley and Betsy because I opened their house in the spring, closed it again in the fall, and looked after it all year long. I'd gotten the job because Stanley and John Skye had gone to college together and John had given Stanley my name. I also opened and closed John's place and cared for it while he and his family were up in Weststock during the winter, where he professed things medieval at the college. I tended to other houses, too, because when you have no steady job, you have to be willing to do a lot of things. </p><p> And now, apparently, I was going to have yet another bit of work: showing Mr. Mahsimba around the Vineyard and helping him achieve whatever he had in mind. </p><p> I thought of John Skye and his family, and was glad I'd gotten the farm ready for their arrival. The twins were now in college, so they'd be getting out of school at the same time as their father did. Thus, all of the Skyes might be descending from America any day now. I presumed that John would arrive before Mr. Mahsimba did. I wondered what Mr. Mahsimba's long story would be, but there was no way to guess. </p><p> I went back to perusing the <i>Gazette.</i> Since I'd taken the phone call, the Headless Horseman was still unidentified, and the case was still open as unsolved murder cases always are. I thought about the Woman in the Dunes, over on Cape Cod. There were similarities between her case and that of the Horseman. The woman's handless body had been found years before in the sand dunes, her jeans folded neatly beside her. She was still unidentified after many years. A very cold case, but one that was still open. </p><p> The latest effort at identifying her involved opening the grave and attempting DNA tests, which hadn't been available when she'd first been found. I imagined that DNA evidence had also been taken from the Horseman, but that nothing had been done with it because of the absence of comparable samples. </p><p> I put the paper down, stopped thinking about crime, finished my coffee, and considered the many things that needed doing. An old guy once told me that the good part about being retired is that you still have lots of things to do but you don't have to do them. I wasn't quite retired, so I still had to do them, but I had some choices about when and in which order. </p><p> So I went fishing. </p><p> It was still early enough in the season for Norton Point Beach to be open, so I went that way, over the sand from Katama toward Chappy. Soon impassioned Department of Fish and Wildlife agents would close Norton Point to ORV traffic on the grounds that passing trucks disturbed nesting and fledging plovers. It was one of those governmental decisions that explains anarchism, since the real threats to plovers, as even the beach-closers knew, were gulls, skunks, and other wild predators. Maddening. When I'm king, I'm shipping all of the plovers and environmentalists to No Man's Land, where they can care for one another and not bother the rest of us. The world will thank me for it. </p><p> I stopped here and there and made casts into the light southwest wind. I caught nothing, but that was okay, because it was a lovely early June day, with bright sun and a clear light blue sky arching down and meeting the dark blue ocean on the southern horizon. If you sailed that way, the first land you'd come to would be Hispaniola, which was well beyond my longest cast. </p><p> I fished awhile at Metcalf's Hole and got one lone five-pound blue which apparently had no friends. I cut his throat, rinsed him off, and put him on the ice in the fish box, then went on to Wasque. </p><p> Wasque Point is the southeastern corner of Chappaquiddick, the peninsula hooked to the rest of the Vineyard by Norton Point Beach. When the water broke through the beach between the ocean and Katama Bay, Chappy became an island and remained one until Neptune in his wisdom closed the opening again. Wasque is one of the best places in the world to catch bluefish, because of the tides that form the Wasque rip, where bait is tossed about and the blues go after it. When conditions are right you can slaughter the blues at Wasque. </p><p> They weren't perfect that morning, but they were good enough, and the surf casters who were stretched in a line along the beach in front of their four-by-fours were busy and happy. I became one of them, and when I finally broke off and went home, the blues were still there, hitting almost anything you threw, filling the air with the scent of watermelon. </p><p> In town I sold all of my fish but one and took that one home. On the filleting table behind our shed I scaled and filleted the fish and then took the fillets into the house and put them in the fridge. We'd have stuffed bluefish for supper. Delish! My mouth was already watering. </p><p> It was a little past noon and I was having my first Sam Adams of the day when the phone rang again. </p><p> John Skye's voice was on the other end. "The groves of academe have shed the Skyes for another summer," said John. "We're here." </p><p> "If I'd known that a little earlier, I'd have brought you a bluefish." </p><p> "I can catch my own bluefish, thanks. Are you busy right now?" </p><p> "I'm drinking a beer, but it won't take long to finish it." </p><p> "Fine. Come on over. There's someone I want you to meet. His name is Mahsimba." </p><p> Copyright � 2002 by Philip R.

His mother decides they must go to Venice to petition the agency that sent Mark&#x2019;s father to send out a search party. Anxious about his father and upset about spending Christmas away from home, Mark gets a bad asthma attack in the middle of the night. That&#x2019;s when Doc Hornaday, an old friend of Mark&#x2019;s father, makes a house call, along with a massive black Tibetan mastiff called Boss. To distract Mark from his wheezing and to pass the long Venetian night, the Doc starts to spin for Mark the tale of Marco Polo. Doc describes Marco&#x2019;s travels and the boy finds himself falling under the spell of the story that has transfixed the world for centuries. Marco&#x2019;s journey bolsters Mark&#x2019;s courage and whets his appetite for risk and adventure, and for exposure to life in all its immense and fascinating variety.</p><p><b>Alan Armstrong</b>&#x2019;s first book, <i>Whittington, </i>was awarded a Newbery Honor in 2006. He lives with his wife, Martha, a painter, in Massachusetts.Grade 5&#x2013;7&#x2014;This story within a story brings to life the adventures of the famed 13th-century Venetian explorer. It begins in the modern day with the disappearance of 11-year-old Mark's father, who is tracing Polo's route through the Gobi desert. Mark and his mother travel to Venice to help with the search. While there, Mark has a terrible asthma attack and meets his dad's army friend Dr. Hornaday, who decides to entertain his patient with imaginative stories about Marco Polo. His tales are full of color and excitement; the details, although they are not based on known historical events, are grounded in the author's research on Polo's times and the places he claimed to have seen. The narrative becomes a little confusing: Hornaday's dog can talk to Mark and describes what Polo's homecoming to Venice was like, as passed down through his dog ancestors. The descriptions of the world in the 13th century are fascinating, and the imagined relationship between Kublai Khan and Polo is intriguing, but due to its complicated structure, this isn't a book for reluctant readers. Illustrations are interspersed throughout. The novel is an excellent supplement for those studying the explorer and his world. Extensive chapter notes are included, but there is no map.&#x2014;<i>Caroline Tesauro, Radford Public Library, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Bronowski&#39;s exciting, splendidly illustrated investigation offers a new perspective not just on science, but on civilization itself. Photographs.</p><p><b>Jacob Bronowski</b> (1908&#x2013;1974) was a mathematician, biologist, science historian, and author. His other well-known works include <i>The Origins of Knowledge and Imagination</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Western Intellectual Tradition, From Leonardo to Hegel</i>. <b>Richard Dawkins</b> is the author of<i> The God Delusion </i>and <i>The Selfish Gene.</i>"The book and television series . . . are a superb teaching tool and a remarkable memorial."&nbsp; &#x2014;Carl Sagan<br><br>"A great book . . . it taught me a huge amount about mixing history and science."&nbsp; &#x2014;Simon Singh, author, <i>The Code Book</i></p><h2>Josefina&#39;s Surprise: A Christmas Story (American Girl Collection)</h2><p>Josefina fears that Christmas will not be the same after the death of her mother, but Christmas Eve brings surprises for all</p><p></p><h2>The Dead Zone</h2><p>Stephen King&#39;s fan-favourite thriller. Also available in audio for the first time, read by Academy Award nominee James Franco.The two things that conjured up that horrible night, were his run of luck at the Wheel of Fortune, and the mask ...Meet Johnny Smith.</p><p>In the <i>St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost &amp; Gothic Writers</i>, Gary Westfahl predicts that "King has already earned himself a place in the history of literature.... At the very least, he will enjoy the status of a latter-day Anthony Trollope, an author respected for his popularity and social commentary.... More likely, he will be enshrined as the Charles Dickens of the late 20th century, the writer who perfectly reflected, encapsulated, and expressed the characteristic concerns of his era." <p> If any of King's novels exemplifies his skill at portraying the concerns of his generation, it's <i>The Dead Zone</i> (1979). Although it contains a horrific subplot about a serial killer, it isn't strictly a horror novel. It's the story of an unassuming high school teacher, an Everyman, who suffers a gap in time--like a Rip Van Winkle who blacks out during the years 1970-75--and thus becomes acutely conscious of the way that American society is rapidly changing. He wakes up as well with a gap in his brain, the "dead zone" of the title. The zone gives him crippling headaches, but also grants him second sight, a talent he doesn't want and is reluctant to use. The crux of the novel concerns whether he will use that talent to alter the course of history.</p><p> <i>The Dead Zone</i> is a tight, well-crafted book. When asked in 1983 which of his novels so far was "the best," Stephen King answered, "The one that I think works the best is <i>Dead Zone</i>. It's the one that [has] the most story." <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Stephen King has been described by the Guardian as &#39;one of the greatest storytellers of our time&#39;, by the Mirror as a &#39;genius&#39; and by The Sunday Times as &#39;one of the most fertile storytellers of the modern novel.&#39; In 2003, he was given the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. He lives with his wife, the novelist Tabitha King, for most of the year in Maine, USA.</p><h2>How to Build a Classic Golf Swing</h2><p><p>Ernie Els is one of the most established names in world golf.

He turned professional in 1989 and in 1992 won the South African PGA, the South African Masters and the South African Open, the first golfer to win that trio of titles since Gary Player. <p>In 1994 he won the US Open at the young age of 24.

Throughout the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Korean War, cotton-based load-carrying equipments served the infantryman with little change in their design and construction. In 1954 a new load-carrying system was developed to meet the needs of the infantryman on the perceived battlefields of the Cold War. At the onset of the Vietnam War it was clear that this new cotton-based webbing system was not acceptable for use in the humid environment of the jungles of Southeast Asia. The answer to the problems plaguing cotton load-carrying equipments came in the form of nylon. Nylon equipment was found to be more durable, lighter and dried quicker than the standardized cotton equipment. As the Vietnam War ground down nylon web equipment was proving to be the answer to other load-carrying problems that had arisen during the course of the war. In 1973 an all-nylon load-carrying equipment system was standardized replacing all cotton-based load-carrying equipments in service at the time. Since 1973 all load-carrying equipments have been fabricated utilizing nylon and, in effect, closed the history book on cotton-based equipments. In this book, C A Monroe and Craig Pickrall describe and illustrate the personal equipment of the US Army soldier throughout the period, and show how it has developed to meet changing operational needs. </p></p><p>C A Monroe has had an interest in military history for many years, and has studied and collected US Army uniforms and equipment for over twenty years.Craig Pickrall has had an interest in military history for many years, and has studied and collected US Army uniforms and equipment for over twenty years.C A Monroe has had an interest in military history for many years, and has studied and collected US Army uniforms and equipment for over twenty years.Craig Pickrall has had an interest in military history for many years, and has studied and collected US Army uniforms and equipment for over twenty years.</p><h2>Trophy Hunter in Asia</h2><p>ELGIN T. GATES, already a living legend in the field of international big-game hunting, won the Weatherby Big-Game trophy in 1960, the "Oscar" of the hunting world. In a vote by an international jury in 1963 to choose the six greatest living hunters in the world, he was selected with this comment: "Elgin Gates is considered by many authorities to be the greatest hunter of them all." He is perhaps the only man in history who has hunted all of the world's continents. In search of rare and exotic species of big-game in far-flung corners of the globe, he has pioneered and opened up new hunting areas, blazing trails for others to follow. He has 121 African trophies listed in Rowland Ward's Records of Big Game. Together with 43 ranking specimens from Asia and others from North America, his grand total of record-class trophies exceeds 200, an achievement unique in the hunting world. As a sportsman in other fields, notably speed-boat racing, Gates won 463 trophies and set 26 U.S., world and international records. He has won 37 Field &amp; Stream "button" awards for game fish, and has many competitive shooting trophies for rifle, pistol and international trap shooting. He is a member of the Shikar-Safari Club, Conseil International de la Chasse, Camp Fire Club of America, Professional Hunter's Association of East Africa and others. He is also interested in archeology and has located and excavated several prehistoric Indian sites, as well as some wagons abandoned by the Donner party of 1846 during their migration to California. Gates lives with his wife, Dollie, in Southern California, where he is at work on two more books on big game, and one on American history.</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Lyrics of Frank Loesser</h2><p>&#x201c;Frank Loesser could write authoritatively in virtually any style and, frankly, did,&#x201d; observed composer-lyricist Maury Yeston. &#x201c;A genius melodist and a supergenius lyricist, only he would ever rhyme &#x2018;pelts&#x2019; with &#x2018;else&#x2019; [&#x201c;Take Back Your Mink&#x201d;] or &#x2018;India&#x2019; with &#x2018;been to ya&#x2019; [&#x201c;They&#x2019;re Either Too Young or Too Old&#x201d;] while simultaneously combining a crackling intellect with a heart as big as the moon.&#x201d;<br><br>Frank Loesser&#x2013;who, like Irving Berlin and Cole Porter, wrote both music and lyrics for his shows&#x2013;has been called the most versatile of Broadway composers. His five musicals are among Broadway&#x2019;s most creative and enduring achievements: <i>Where&#x2019;s Charley?, Guys and Dolls </i>(for which he won his first Tony Award), <i>The Most Happy Fella, Greenwillow</i>, and <i>How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</i> (for which he won both the Tony and the Pulitzer Prize). But well before Loesser wrote his first show, he was known to America for the song hits of his Hollywood career, including the Oscar-winning &#x201c;Baby, It&#x2019;s Cold Outside,&#x201d; &#x201c;On a Slow Boat to China,&#x201d; &#x201c;Two Sleepy People,&#x201d; &#x201c;Heart and Soul,&#x201d; &#x201c;I Don&#x2019;t Want to Walk Without You,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Spring Will Be a Little Late This Year,&#x201d; as well as the wartime hit &#x201c;Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition.&#x201d;<br><br>Robert Kimball and Steve Nelson have gathered lyrics from such varied sources as rare private recordings, the personal files of Frank Loesser, and the archives of various film studios. Here, too, are photographs of the stars who helped make Loesser&#x2019;s songs famous, such as Bob Hope, Dorothy Lamour, Marlene Dietrich, Ray Bolger, and Betty Hutton. Kimball and Nelson&#x2019;s research has yielded many previously &#x201c;lost&#x201d; lyrics, making it possible for the first time to fully grasp the extent of Frank Loesser&#x2019;s extraordinary talent.</p><p>Robert Kimball was educated at Yale College and Yale Law School. He has been the music critic of the <i>New York Post</i> and is the co-author or editor of several books on musical theater, including <i>Cole,</i> the celebrated book about Cole Porter that he edited with Brendan Gill. He also edited Knopf&#x2019;s four previous books in the Complete Lyrics series. He is co-editor, with Robert Gottlieb, of <i>Reading Lyrics.</i> Mr. Kimball lives in New York. <br><br>Steve Nelson is a professor of musical theater at New York University and the producer of the Songwriter Series for the Library of Congress, which releases recordings of Broadway songwriters performing their own material. He is also the author of <i>Only a Paper Moon: The Theatre of Billy Rose.</i> Mr. Nelson lives in New York.The fifth of Kimball and Nelson's big, square, lavishly illustrated books full of the best American words ever set to music corrals the complete songs of a figure who somehow always gets second billing to Hart, Hammerstein, Porter, and Ira Gershwin. Perhaps Loesser (1910-69) wasn't as consistently witty as Hart, as romantic as Hammerstein, or as both as Porter and Ira. But he wrote words <i>and</i> music for <i>Guys and Dolls</i>; the "operatic" <i>Most Happy Fella</i> (the major through-sung show between <i>Porgy and Bess</i> and Sondheim); and the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>How to Succeed in Business without Really Trying</i>. Great shows, all of 'em. And how about "Baby, It's Cold Outside," his Oscar winner? Rodgers himself said it was one of the best songs he'd ever heard. And after Coltrane and Sheila Jordan, what self-respecting bopper doesn't blow Loesser's "Inch Worm" (from the movie <i>Hans Christian Andersen</i>)? Stands to reason that the trove containing stuff that good has scads more as good or close. It does, it does. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

For Manicheans, the universe was ruled by a Lord of Light and a Lord of Darkness, who fought continuously for supremacy. All that was good was a gift from the Lord of Light, and all that was evil was an affliction visited by the Lord of Darkness. This dualism extended to cosmogony and ethics, splitting the universe into a spiritual realm that acted on the goodness of the human soul and a material realm that abetted the evil of the human body. These stark oppositions mask a remarkable degree of doctrinal and liturgical complexity, the details of which have been obscured by centuries of suppression and persecution, first by the Christian church, then by Islam.</p><p>One of the world's foremost experts on ancient religions, Michel Tardieu examines the fragmentary sources that have come down to us, pieces together the life and teachings of the prophet Mani (the itinerant Persian preacher and founder of this long lost faith), illuminates Manichaeism's ecclesiastical hierarchy and distinctive moral code, and investigates its ideas about the pre-life and afterlife. <i>Manichaeism</i> provides a brilliantly compact survey of what was once one of the world's great faiths, and then became one of its great heresies, surviving now only as a shadowy presence haunting the religions that superseded it.</p></p><p>Michel Tardieu holds the Chair in the Syncretisms of Late Antiquity at the College de France. His many books include <i>La Formation des canons scriptuaires</i>. M. B. DeBevoise has translated or edited some thirty works from the French and Italian."Tardieu's book on Manichaeism is a marvelous short introduction to a very complex religious phenomenon of the ancient and medieval world. A justified and timely translation, this work is an excellent entry into the critical issues at stake in reconstructing Manichaean history and religion."--Paul M.

[Wells] has chosen an approach that is more musing than instructing, and in doing so he opens up our personal responses to Hopper&#39;s work... In these pages, as he defines and the refines his interpretations, I think Wells may have stumbled on why we keep coming back to these paintings... Hopper&#39;s implicit storylines, his narratives which engender tense, suspended silences, are what make his images so compelling.

Taking gender as part of the intricate, unpredictable action in jazz culture, this interdisciplinary collection explores the terrain opened up by listening, with big ears, for gender in jazz. Essays range from a reflection on the female boogie-woogie pianists who played at Caf� Society in New York during the 1930s and 1940s to interpretations of how the jazzman is represented in Dorothy Baker&#x2019;s novel <i>Young Man with a Horn</i> (1938) and Michael Curtiz&#x2019;s film adaptation (1950). Taken together, the essays enrich the field of jazz studies by showing how gender dynamics have shaped the production, reception, and criticism of jazz culture.<p></p><p>Scholars of music, ethnomusicology, American studies, literature, anthropology, and cultural studies approach the question of gender in jazz from multiple perspectives. One contributor scrutinizes the tendency of jazz historiography to treat singing as subordinate to the predominantly male domain of instrumental music, while another reflects on her doubly inappropriate position as a female trumpet player and a white jazz musician and scholar. Other essays explore the composer George Russell&#x2019;s Lydian Chromatic Concept as a critique of mid-twentieth-century discourses of embodiment, madness, and black masculinity; performances of &#x201c;female hysteria&#x201d; by Les Diaboliques, a feminist improvising trio; and the BBC radio broadcasts of Ivy Benson and Her Ladies&#x2019; Dance Orchestra during the Second World War.

Read by Mary Louise Parker.</p><p>Richard Bachman is really Stephen King, and <b>The Regulators</b> is a kind of companion novel to Desperation, which was published simultaneously. These books mark the return of the Stephen King of old; the Stephen King of The Stand and Pet Sematary, where good and evil were at war and blood and gore flowed through the pages. The companion novels center around a new personification of evil that goes by the name of Tak, unearthed by an evil mining company that's destroying the earth in the name of profit.

The stories collected here range from delightfully barbed portraits of the British upper classes to an alternative ending to Waugh's novel <i>A Handful of Dust;</i> from a "missing chapter" in the life of Charles Ryder, the nostalgic hero of <i>Brideshead Revisited, </i>to a plot-packed morality tale that Waugh composed at a very tender age; from an epistolary lark in the voice of "a young lady of leisure" to a darkly comic tale of scandal in a remote (and imaginary) African outpost.The Complete Stories is a dazzling distillation of Waugh's genius-abundant evidence that one of the twentieth century's most admired and enjoyed English novelists was also a master of the short form.</p><p>Mordant, mirthful, and unrelenting in their lampoon of aristocratic mischief, Evelyn Waugh's novels have earned him a permanent place in the literary pantheon. But this cantankerous master--the scion, by the way, of a decidedly middle-class family of publishers and writers--was no less adept when it came to the short form. Indeed, Waugh first broke into print in 1926 with "The Balance: A Yarn of the Good Old Days of Broad Trousers and High Necked Jumpers," an early story that suggests a modernized and misanthropic P.G. Wodehouse. And he continued to write short fiction throughout the rest of his career, all of which has now been collected in the delectable <i>Complete Stories of Evelyn Waugh</i>. <p> The first few entries in the collection capture a kinder, gentler author, not yet red at the verbal tooth and claw. But by 1932, when he wrote "Love in the Slump," Waugh's eye for the black-comic detail was firmly in place: </p><blockquote> It rained heavily on the day of the wedding, and only the last-ditchers among the St. Margaret's crowd turned out to watch the melancholy succession of guests popping out of their dripping cars and plunging up the covered way into the church.... A doctor was summoned to attend the bridegroom's small nephew, who, after attracting considerable attention as a page at the ceremony by his outspoken comments, developed a high temperature and numerous disquieting symptoms of food poisoning. </blockquote> Waugh's wit only sharpened throughout the succeeding decades, and the very texture of his prose thickened (although it never took on much in the way of modernist adipose tissue). In "Compassion," a 1949 tale that belies the author's vaunted anti-Semitism, a mere glimpse of some Yugoslavian partisans leads to this superabundant sentence: "He passed ragged, swaggering partisans, all young, some scarcely more than children; girls in battle dress, bandaged, bemedalled, girdled with grenades, squat, chaste, cheerful, sexless, barely human, who had grown up in mountain bivouacs, singing patriotic songs, arm-in-arm along the pavements where a few years earlier rheumatics had crept with parasols and light, romantic novels." Nobody can accuse Waugh of squishy sentimentality--remember, romantic prose is strictly for convalescents. Still, <i>The Complete Stories</i> offers an accurate and stupendously entertaining vision of human folly, no less effective for being administered in smaller doses.Evelyn Waugh (1903-1966), whom <i>Time</i> called "one of the century's great masters of English prose," wrote several widely acclaimed novels as well as volumes of biography, memoir, travel writing, and journalism. Three of his novels, <i>A Handful of Dust, Scoop, </i>and<i> Brideshead Revisited,</i> were selected by the Modern Library as among the 100 best novels of the twentieth century.</p><h2>I Love You All the Time</h2><p>Board book version of the popular children&#39;s paperback of the same title.

As the sister to the King of Muman, Fidelma's marriage ceremony is a major event; the High King of Ireland, as well as other kings and major figures, are going to be in attendance.&nbsp;On the eve of the ceremony, the fanatical and much disliked Abbot Ultan is found murdered in his chamber and one of the distinguished guests, the King of Connacht, is accused of the crime. Her wedding delayed, the high born guests restless, and the murder and its aftermath threatening chaos, it's up to Fidelma to uncover the murderer - and the truth behind the murder itself - if the often tenuous peace of&nbsp;the land&nbsp;is to be maintained.</p><p>PETER TREMAYNE&nbsp;is the pseudonym of Peter Berresford Ellis, a renowned scholar of the ancient Celts and the Irish.

He lives in London.CHAPTER ONE &#x2018;Have a care, S�gdae of Imleach, lest you be faced with death and eternal damnation!&#x2019; <br>As he spoke, Abbot Ult�n smote the table in front of him with a balled fist. <br>There was an audible gasp from those seated on the opposite side of the dark oak boards. Only the man to whom the words were addressed seemed unconcerned. S�gdae, the tall, silver-haired abbot and bishop of Imleach, sat relaxed in his chair with a smile on his face. <br>There were six men and two women seated at the table in the sanctum of the abbot of Imleach. On one side was Abbot S�gdae with his steward and two of the venerable scholars of the abbey. Facing them was Ult�n, abbot of Cill Ria and bishop of the U� Thuirtr�, who sat with his scribe and two female members of his abbey. <br>Now, in the flickering candlelight which lit the gloomy chamber, even Abbot Ult�n&#x2019;s companions began to look concerned at the intemperance of his language. <br>There was but a moment&#x2019;s pause after Abbot Ult�n&#x2019;s outburst before Abbot S�gdae&#x2019;s steward, the rechtaire of the abbey of Imleach, Brother Madagan, leaned forward from his chair at the abbot&#x2019;s side with an angry scowl on his face. <br>&#x2018;Do you dare to use threats, Ult�n of the U� Thuirtr�? Do you know to whom you speak? You speak to the Comarb, the successor of the Blessed Ailbe, chief bishop of the Faith in this kingdom of Muman. Imleach has never recognised the claims of Ard Macha. Indeed, is it not accepted that the Blessed Ailbe brought the Word of Christ to this place even before Patrick was engaged on his mission to the northern kingdoms? So have a care with your bombast and threats lest your words rebound on your own head.&#x2019; <br>The animosity in Brother Madagan&#x2019;s voice was controlled, the words coldly spoken but none the less threatening for that. <br>Abbot S�gdae reached forward and laid a restraining hand on his steward&#x2019;s arm. His soft blue eyes remained fixed upon Bishop Ult�n&#x2019;s flushed, wrathful features and he let forth a sigh. <br>&#x2018;Aequo animo, Brother Madagan,&#x2019; he admonished his steward, urging him to calmness. &#x2018;Aequo animo. I am sure that Abbot Ult�n did not mean to imply a physical threat to me. That would be unthinkable in one who has been granted the hospitality of this house.&#x2019; Was there a slight emphasis, a gentle rebuke in that sentence? &#x201c;The abbot was but giving voice to his conviction of the righteousness of his cause. Yet perhaps he was a little over-zealous in his choice of words?&#x2019; <br>Abbot S�gdae paused, clearly waiting for the response. <br>There was a silence broken only by the crackle of the dry logs burning in the hearth at the far end of the chamber and by the winter wind moaning round the grey stones of the abbey walls. Even though it was late afternoon, it could have been midnight for it was dubhluacran, the darkest part of the year. Within a few days it would be the phase of the moon anciently called &#x2018;the period of rest&#x2019;, mi faoide, which started in contrary fashion with the feast of Imbolc, when the ewes began to come into lamb. It was a long, anxious time in the country. <br>That very noon Abbot Ult�n and his three followers had arrived at the abbey and announced that he was a special emissary from S�g�ne, abbot and bishop of Ard Macha, the Cormarb or heir to the Blessed Patrick. S�g�ne was regarded by many as the senior churchman in the northern kingdom of Ulaidh. Having been granted hospitality, Abbot Ult�n and his companions had presented themselves in Abbot Se�gdae&#x2019;s sanctum to deliver their message. <br>The proposal put forward by Abbot Ult�n was simple. Abbot S�gdae, as the most senior churchman in Muman, was to recognise S�g�ne of Ard Macha as archiepiscopus, chief bishop of all the kingdoms of �ireann. To support the claim, Abbot Ult�n pointed out that the Blessed Patrick the Briton had received the pallium from the bishop of Rome, who was regarded as the chief bishop of the Faith. Patrick had then proceeded to convert the people of �ireann. He had made Ard Macha his primary seat and it was therefore argued that the bishops of that place should hold religious governance over all the five kingdoms and their sub-kingdoms. <br>Abbot S�gdae had listened in polite silence while the northern cleric had put forward his argument, which was delivered in such blunt terms as almost to constitute a demand. When the envoy had sat back, Abbot S�gdae had pointed out, politely but with firmness, that churchmen and scholars from the other kingdoms of �ireann would argue that Patrick the Briton, blessed as he was, was not the first who had preached the New Faith in the land. Many others had come before him and one of these had converted Ailbe, son of Olcnais of Araid Cliach in the north-west of Muman, who had established his seat at Imleach. It was the great abbey in which they were presently gathered that was regarded by all the people of Muman as the chief centre of their faith, and when, in recent times, the abbots and bishops of Ard Macha had begun to assert their claims, they were immediately challenged by Imleach and most of the other churches in each of the five kingdoms of �ireann. <br>It had been at that point that Abbot Ult�n, a vain man of middle age, quite handsome in a dark, saturnine way, had pounded the table with his fist, clearly unused to anyone challenging his authority. <br>Following Abbot S�gdae&#x2019;s gentle rebuke, there was silence round the table. All eyes were upon the arrogant envoy of Ard Macha. <br>Abbot Ult�n flushed as he regarded the open hostility on the face of Brother Madagan and the others who sat across the table on either side of his host. Beside him, his scribe, Brother Dr�n, a thin, elderly man, with sharp features and birdlike movements, bent quickly forward and whispered in his ear, &#x2018;Aurea mediocritas.&#x2019; He was urging the abbot to employ moderation: the &#x2018;golden mean&#x2019;. Attack was no way to win an argument when faced with such opposition. <br>Abbot Ult�n finally shrugged and tried to force a smile. <br>&#x2018;The words were spoken in the zealousness of my cause and intended no threat, physical or otherwise, to you, my dear brother in Christ, or to anyone here,&#x2019; he said unctuously. But there was no disguising the falseness of his tone. &#x2018;I would simply ask for a moment more in order to clarify my argument, for I fear that I must have presented it badly.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;We have heard Ard Macha&#x2019;s argument and do not agree with it,&#x2019; snapped Brother Madagan. <br>Again Abbot S�gdae laid a hand on his arm and said, without glancing at him: &#x2018;My steward, too, is zealous for the rights of this abbey. Audi alteram partem &#x2013; we will hear the other side, for there are two sides to every question. You seem to think, my dear brother in Christ&#x2019; &#x2013; Ult�n glanced up sharply: was he being mocked? &#x2013; &#x2018;you seem to imply that there is more to set before us for our consideration. Is that so?&#x2019; <br>Abbot Ult�n nodded quickly. &#x2018;My scribe, Brother Dr�n, will continue for me.&#x2019; <br>The sharp-faced scribe, seated at Abbot Ult�n&#x2019;s side, cleared his throat. &#x2018;I beg leave to read from a sacred book of Ard Macha.&#x2019; He turned quickly to the fair-faced sister of the Faith at his side. &#x2018;Sister Marga, the book, please.&#x2019; <br>Thus addressed, his neighbour reached into a satchel that she was carrying and drew forth a small calf-bound book, which she handed to Brother Dron. The scribe took it and turned to a pre-marked page and began to intone: &#x2018;A celestial messenger appeared before the Blessed Patrick and spoke to him, saying, &#x201c;The Lord God has given all the territories of the Irish in modum paruchiae to you and to your city, which the Irish call in their language Ard Macha&#x2014;&#x2019; &#x201d; <br>Abbot S�gdae interrupted. &#x2018;Brother Dron, I presume that you are reading from the book that you call Liber Angeli? It is already known to us; indeed, we have asked Ard Macha for permission to send a scribe to make a copy for our own scriptorium.&#x2019; <br>Brother Dr�n looked up with a frown. &#x2018;I am, indeed, reading from the Book of the Angel. In virtue of this miraculous appearance to the Blessed Patrick, Ard Macha claims to hold supreme authority over the churches and monasteries of the five kingdoms of �ireann. All the houses of the Faith must defer to the authority of Ard Macha and pay tribute to it both spiritual and material.&#x2019; Brother Dr�n tapped the vellum page with his forefinger. &#x2018;That is what is written here, Abbot S�gdae. This is why we have come to ask your obedience to this sacred instruction.&#x2019; <br>Abbot S�gdae&#x2019;s smile seemed to broaden as he shook his head. <br>&#x2018;When I was a young man, I visited your great abbey at Ard Macha.&#x2019; He spoke slowly, almost dreamily. &#x2018;I met with its scribes and scholars.&#x2019; He paused and for a few moments they waited in silence, but he did not continue. He seemed to have drifted off into his memories. <br>Brother Dr�n glanced nervously at Abbot Ult�n. <br>&#x2018;What relevance has this?&#x2019; he finally demanded. <br>&#x2018;Relevance?&#x2019; Abbot S�gdae looked up and frowned as if surprised by the question. Then he smiled again. &#x2018;I was just thinking back to the time before this celestial message was ever known at Ard Macha. This book and its claims appear to have only recently come to light.&#x2019; <br>At that moment, Sister Marga, who had been taking notes, snapped her quill. Brother Dr�n turned to her with a frown, she muttered a hurried apology. <br>Brother Madagan ignored the interruption and added cuttingly: &#x2018;Not even Muirch� maccu Machtheri, the first great biographer of Patrick, argued that Ard Macha was the place wherein Patrick&#x2019;s earthly remains repose. It is we...</p><h2>Walter Benjamin: Selected Writings, Volume 2: 1927-1934</h2><p><p> In the frenzied final years of the Weimar Republic, amid economic collapse and mourning political catastrophe, Walter Benjamin emerged as the most original practicing literary critic and public intellectual in the German-speaking world. Volume 2 of Selected Writings, covering the years 1927 to 1934, displays the full spectrum of Benjamin's achievements at this pivotal stage in his career. </p><p> Previously concerned chiefly with literary theory, Benjamin during these Years does pioneering work in new areas, from the stud of popular Culture (a discipline he virtually created) to theories of the media and the visual arts. His writings on the theory of modernity-most of them new to readers of English--develop ideas as important to an understanding of the twentieth century as an contained in his widely anthologiied essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Technological Reproducibility. </p><p> This volume brings together previously untranslated writings on major figures such as Brecht, Val�ry and Gide, and on subjects ranging from film, radio, and the novel to memory, kitsch, and the theory of language. We find the manifoldly inquisitive Benjamin musing on the new modes of perception opened tip by techniques of photographic enlargement and cinematic montage, on the life and work of &amp; Goethe at Weimar, on the fascination of old toys and the mysteries of food, and on the allegorical significance of Mickey Mouse. </p></p><p>A leading German critic from the generation of Europeans scarred by the First World War, Walter Benjamin (1892-1940) had a writing career marked by deep philosophical insights and tumultuous emotional crises. But until recently, most of his work was unavailable in English; the handful of essays that could be read in English, like "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," were undisputed classics, but the full spectrum of Benjamin's thought remained untapped. That has changed with Harvard University's publication of the multivolume <i>Selected Writings</i>. This second volume covers Benjamin's work from 1927 to 1934, the period in which he established himself as a leading public intellectual, and encompasses a wide variety of literary forms addressing an even wider variety of subject matter. From interviews with Andr� Gide to film reviews of work by Chaplin and Eisenstein, from the autobiographical recollections of "A Berlin Chronicle" to his reflections on the cultural nostalgia for children's literature and toys, Benjamin wrote with perception and unflagging inquisitiveness. The editors have provided a chronological essay, which helps place the assembled writings in the context of Benjamin's life; the collection considered as a whole will undoubtedly be of vital importance to any scholar of modern European philosophy.Walter Benjamin (1892-1940) was the author of many works of literary and cultural analysis.</p><h2>Garbage: A Poem</h2><p>The subject of garbage serves as the inspiration for a new collection of poetry, by the award-winning author of Sumerian Vistas, that explores the themes of nature and mutability.</p><p>"Garbage," A.R. Ammons writes in this book-length poem, "has to be the poem of our time because / garbage is spiritual, believable enough / to get our attention, getting in the way..." Talky and playful, the couplets of the National Book Award-winning <i>Garbage</i> propel one through the trash dump of 20th-century meaning, as well as into the past and future, where "millennia jiggle in your eyes at night." This project, by turns wryly self-deprecating and densely philosophical, places Ammons in the company of such recent epic funnymen as John Ashbery, Ronald Johnson, and, very self-consciously, William Carlos Williams. Like any good epic, the poem begins in doubt, with Ammons wondering whether to write the book or simply retire and live a life of leisure on Social Security (plus a surely ample pension from his longtime Cornell University professorship). Like John Milton in the preamble to his epic, <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Ammons uses the metaphor of a tree to focus his poetic ambition. "I mean," he writes, "take my yard maple--put out in the free / and open--has overgrown, its trunk / split down from a high fork ... The fat tree, unable to stop pouring it on, overfed and overgrew ... It just / goes to show you: moderation imposed is better / than no moderation at all." Indeed, the poem's 121 pages seem at times nothing more than an attempt to buoy the moment between two extremes: exuberant falsehoods at one end of the scale, cynical platitudes on the other. This "moderation" has served as Ammons' dominant aesthetic during his long poetic career, though <i>Garbage</i>'s length and epic ambitions disrupt his trademark austerity. Despite his tangential questioning of reality and time, the poem's ultimate wisdom lies in how it imagines the actively good person, one who sees that <blockquote> ...life, life is like a poem: the moment it<br> begins, it begins to end: the tension this<br> <p> establishes makes every move and movement, every<br> gap and stumble, every glide and rise significant<br> </p></blockquote> In a time when most poetry is about loss, Ammons wanders through our community junkyard and, with his good eye, points out what's valuable, and tells us, in his trustworthy tone, why. <i>--Edward Skoog</i>A.

There are no fences, no guards, no locked gates. But McLean Hospital is a mental institution - one of the most famous, most elite, and once most luxurious in America. McLean &#34;alumni&#34; include many of the troubled geniuses of our age - Olmsted himself, Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, James Taylor and Ray Charles - as well as (more secretly) other notables from among the rich and famous. In its &#34;golden age,&#34; McLean provided as gracious and gentle an enviroment for the treatment of mental illness as one could imagine. &#34;If the patient did not like the lamb we served for dinner and asked for lobster, we gave lobster,&#34; one steward recalled. &#34;They could afford it. Appleton House [the men&#39;s ward] was like the Ritz Carlton.&#34; But the golden age is over, and a downsized, downscale McLean is struggling to find its place in today&#39;s brave new world of psychopharmacologically-oriented mental health care.</p><p>Alex Beam's <i>Gracefully Insane</i> is a knowledgeable historical portrait of New England's McLean Hospital, until recently the mental institution equivalent of the Plaza Hotel. Fenceless and unguarded, McLean's grounds were landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted. Amenities included tennis courts, a golf course, room service, and a riding stable. As one director said, "If you don't know where you are, then you're in the right place." Its patients have included James Taylor, Robert Lowell, and Ray Charles. It also looms large in <i>The Bell Jar</i> and <i>Girl, Interrupted</i>, written by former patients Sylvia Plath and Susanna Kaysen. Beam weaves patients' and employees' stories with an informal review of mental health treatments through the years, including lobotomies, insulin-induced comas, ice-water baths, and a ghastly device called the "coercion chair." <i>Gracefully Insane</i> is amiable, lively, and honest. Its many anecdotes (derived from patient records, journals, and interviews) are by turns poignant, humorous, and unsettling. <i>--H.

He is not in particularly good odor nowadays. A deluge of recent books and films has swept Jesus back into the public eye, but the apostle to the gentiles, whose Epistles fill nearly as many pages in the New Testament as the Gospels, languishes under a cloud of contempt. <p> The aversion is widely shared. Many Christians believe that rather than spreading the message of Jesus to the world, he betrayed it. Most Jews harbor a distinct dislike for this teacher of Torah who converted to Christianity. Besides, isn't he the original source of Christian anti-Semitism? Didn't he condemn Jewish law, exalt faith over works, and crisscross the Roman Empire urging synagogue congregations to accept Jesus as the Messiah? Didn't this prissy arch-patriarch warn women not to speak in churches, to cover their heads when they pray and to be submissive to their husbands? Isn't he also the font of Christian homophobia? All in all, the man some people call the true founder of Christianity does not seem to have many friends out there today.</p><p> But, says Garry Wills in his new and lucid book, all these depreciators are just plain wrong. Paul was neither an anti-Semite nor a misogynist. In fact, he never converted to Christianity at all, which did not yet exist when he had his blinding experience on the Damascus road. What happened to him on the road was not a religious conversion. It was a call, similar to those received by the Hebrew prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah before him. As for women, the verses that put uppity sisters in their place are found not in Paul's writings but in those falsely attributed to him. Paul himself frequently commends women leaders in the congregations and proclaims that in these new messianic congregations there should be "neither male nor female, neither slave nor free." </p><p> What happened on the Damascus road was that God charged Paul with a message and a mission: Go tell Jews everywhere that the messianic era they had prayed for had dawned and that a certain rabbi from Nazareth, slain by the Romans as a threat to their empire and raised from the dead by God, was the long-anticipated Messiah. Therefore, Paul insisted, the hour had now come -- as the prophets had foretold -- to welcome the gentiles into the covenant community previously restricted to the seed of Abraham.</p><p> Not everyone believed Paul's message, of course, but enough -- both Jews and gentiles -- did to constitute a new movement within an already diverse Jewish community. Paul had no intention of starting a new religion. The only Bible he knew (and he knew it well) was the Jewish Scriptures. Wills believes that if Paul could have foreseen that his occasional letters to the small congregations he had launched in Corinth, Ephesus and other imperial cities would one day be collected in something called the "New Testament," and that the only scripture he knew would be called "old," he would have vociferously objected. </p><p> Still, one old and vexing question remains: Why did a tiny Jewish sect, born in Palestine, spread with such uncanny rapidity through the Roman world? Wills suggests simply that the time was ripe for just such a message. With the Roman pantheon in decay -- dismissed by thoughtful people as mere superstition -- and with Roman society rife with moral putrescence, the Jews' strict monotheism and stern morality held a powerful attraction. Large numbers of gentiles were already attending synagogues but hesitated to undergo the circumcision and dietary restrictions required for conversion. At the same time, many Jews were looking for a more universal expression of their faith, in keeping with the emerging cosmopolitan culture. Paul's message attracted both. He taught that God had given his law to both Jews and gentiles, the former in the Torah, the latter by nature. All had fallen short, but now all were forgiven and called to constitute a single new and inclusive community in which there was "neither Jew nor Greek."</p><p> Wills is not a biblical scholar, but he is a voracious reader and an eloquent writer who makes judicious use of the best recent scholarship. So it is odd that he ignores the most exciting new direction in Pauline research, which suggests that the Roman Empire was not just the background of Paul's life and work but shaped his every word and deed. The empire was shaky, and Paul discerned its inner rot. He saw his task as preparing infrastructure that would replace it when it collapsed. Thus he gave the congregations he organized a political, not a religious name: "ecclesia," meaning an official assembly of citizens. When these upstarts insisted that there was someone higher than Caesar to whom they owed supreme loyalty, Roman officials saw that they threatened the symbolic capstone of the whole system. The empire executed Peter and Paul, and Jesus before them, because the imperial elites did not view their movement as a harmless, otherworldly cult but as a real and present danger. </p><p> Paul has gotten a bad rap. He took the first big step in transforming a universal message, stifled by a provincial culture, into a world-circling faith. It is time to free him from the misconceptions that have distorted his significance.</p><p>Reviewed by Harvey Cox <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

More than a matter of intellectual discourse, the idea of justice plays a real role in how&#x2014;and how well&#x2014;people live. And in this book the distinguished scholar Amartya Sen offers a powerful critique of the theory of social justice that, in its grip on social and political thinking, has long left practical realities far behind. </p><p> The transcendental theory of justice, the subject of Sen&#x2019;s analysis, flourished in the Enlightenment and has proponents among some of the most distinguished philosophers of our day; it is concerned with identifying perfectly just social arrangements, defining the nature of the perfectly just society. The approach Sen favors, on the other hand, focuses on the comparative judgments of what is &#x201c;more&#x201d; or &#x201c;less&#x201d; just, and on the comparative merits of the different societies that actually emerge from certain institutions and social interactions. </p><p> At the heart of Sen&#x2019;s argument is a respect for reasoned differences in our understanding of what a &#x201c;just society&#x201d; really is. People of different persuasions&#x2014;for example, utilitarians, economic egalitarians, labor right theorists, no�-nonsense libertarians&#x2014;might each reasonably see a clear and straightforward resolution to questions of justice; and yet, these clear and straightforward resolutions would be completely different. In light of this, Sen argues for a comparative perspective on justice that can guide us in the choice between alternatives that we inevitably face. </p></p><p>, winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Economics, is Lamont University Professor, Harvard University.The most important contribution to the subject since John Rawls' <i>A Theory of Justice</i>. Sen argues that what we urgently need in our troubled world is not a theory of an ideally just state, but a theory that can yield judgments as to comparative justice, judgments that tell us when and why we are moving closer to or farther away from realizing justice in the present globalized world.<br> --Hilary Putnam, Harvard University<br><br>In lucid and vigorous prose, <i>The Idea of Justice</i> gives us a political philosophy that is dedicated to the reduction of injustice on Earth rather than to the creation of ideally just castles in the air.

The Rawlsian project of trying to describe ideally just institutions is a distracting and ultimately fruitless way to think about social injustice, Mr. Sen complains. Such a spirited attack against possibly the most influential English-speaking political philosopher of the past 100 years will alone excite attention. <i>The Idea of Justice</i> serves also as a commanding summation of Mr. Sen's own work on economic reasoning and on the elements and measurement of human well-being...Mr. Sen writes with dry wit, a feel for history and a relaxed cosmopolitanism...<i>The Idea of Justice</i> is a feast...Nobody can reasonably complain any longer that they do not see how the parts of Mr. Sen's grand enterprise fit together...Mr. Sen ends, suitably, with democracy.

Marc Egnal contends that economics, more than any other factor, moved the country to war in 1861.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Drawing on a wealth of primary and secondary sources, Egnal shows that between 1820 and 1850, patterns of trade and production drew the North and South together and allowed sectional leaders to broker a series of compromises. After midcentury, however, all that changed as the rise of the Great Lakes economy reoriented Northern trade along east-west lines. Meanwhile, in the South, soil exhaustion, concerns about the country&#x2019;s westward expansion, and growing ties between the Upper South and the free states led many cotton planters to contemplate secession.

The outpouring of books about the causes of the conflict, Abraham Lincoln, and the war itself continues unabated. And for good reason. Whether the issue is race, region, or industrialization, the Civil War has left a deep imprint on modern America. You would think that after all these years historians would agree on why the country came to blows. But they do not. In many ways, to be sure, our knowledge of the era has advanced remarkably, particularly since the 1960s, when I attended graduate school. During the past decades there has been an outpouring of works on politics, the economy, and ideology. Bookshelves fill with biographies and studies of secession, as well as works on the role of African Americans, women, and the less wealthy. Printed volumes of papers and new sources on the Internet have proved a marvelous boon for researchers. So what is the problem? Why cannot historians explain the origins of the Civil War&#x2014;or at least agree on the general outlines of an interpretation? Part of the difficulty lies with the very abundance&nbsp;of material. No one individual could come close to mastering the relevant secondary and primary sources. Even those who work on a single state can spend decades understanding events in one commonwealth. Part of the problem lies in the nature of what historians do. Despite the dreams of a few theorists, writing history remains as much an art as a science.<br>Still, there is no reason to abandon the question or succumb to an &#x201c;anything goes&#x201d; relativism. The Civil War is too important to leave alone. It haunts anyone who wonders how the United States came to be the country it is today. Moreover, professional scholars agree on a great deal before they begin to&nbsp; disagree. Almost all acknowledge the widespread racism in the North. Very few see African Americans as docile, childlike creatures. Most historians recognize the dynamic nature of the Northern economy at least from the 1820s onward&#x2014;even as they argue about the pace of change in the South. Debates among scholars tend to be exchanges among the well informed. They are clashes between two lawyers who agree about certain facts but differ markedly in the way they interpret those facts.<br><i>Clash of Extremes</i> is presented in that spirit. It is written, in part, because of the importance of the topic and the new vistas opened by the literature of the past decades. It is also written because of the<br>problems that beset recent interpretations. If there is a leading explanation today, it is one that harkens back to earlier views. Many historians now affirm the traditional wisdom that slavery caused the Civil<br>War. The North, led by the Republican Party, attacked the institution, the South defended it, and war was the result. James McPherson, the best-known scholar writing today on the Civil War, entitled his great work <i>Battle Cry of Freedom</i> and labeled Lincoln&#x2019;s victory &#x201c;the revolution of 1860.&#x201d; He quotes approvingly a Southern newspaper that in 1860 described the triumphant Republicans as a &#x201c;party founded on the single sentiment . . . of hatred of African slavery.&#x201d; Southerners, according to McPherson, had no choice but to respond to this threat&nbsp;and did so in &#x201c;the counterrevolution of 1861.&#x201d; Reviewing a book by Maury Klein, McPherson notes: &#x201c;If anyone still has doubts about the salience of slavery as the root of secession, Klein&#x2019;s evidence should remove them.&#x201d; In short, according to McPherson and the historians who agree with him, the North&#x2019;s passionate opposition to slavery and<br>the equally fervent Southern defense of the institution caused the sectional clash.<br>There are, however, difficulties with this &#x201c;idealistic&#x201d; explanation. To begin with, an emphasis on strongly held views about slavery sheds little light on the sequence of events that led to the Civil War. At least<br>since the beginning of the nineteenth century, Northerners had resolutely condemned slavery, even if few advocated immediate abolition. This hostility to bondage, however, marked both the era of compromise,<br>1820 to 1850, as well as the increasingly bitter clashes of the 1850s, culminating in war. A persuasive interpretation must look elsewhere to explain why a lengthy period of cooperation gave way to one of<br>conflict.<br>A focus on slavery also explains little about the divisions within the North and the South. It assumes unity in each of these regions when in fact there was fragmentation. Southerners who deemed the Republican victory so threatening that they called for secession comprised a distinct minority within their section. Of the fifteen slave states only seven, located in the Deep South, left the Union before fighting broke out. And many people in those seven states resisted immediate secession. At least 40 percent of voters, and in some cases half, opposed immediate secession in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The Border States&#x2014;Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri&#x2014;remained in the Union, while the Upper South states&#x2014;Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas&#x2014;joined the Confederacy only after Lincoln&#x2019;s call for troops forced them to choose sides. One hundred thousand whites (along with a larger number of blacks) from the Confederate states fought for the Union. There is no question that <i>some</i> individuals in the South felt that Lincoln&#x2019;s election posed a mortal threat to slavery, but more did not.<br>Similarly, the North was divided in the years before the war, with only the Republicans rejecting compromise. In 1856 most Northerners backed the Republicans&#x2019; opponents, and even in 1860 45 percent of the North voted for a candidate other than Lincoln. A convincing explanation must shed light on all groups and not simply focus on those whose outlook fits the interpretation.<br>Finally, the idealistic interpretation distorts the policies and positions of the Republican Party. Unquestionably Republicans, like virtually all free state residents, condemned slavery. But for most Republicans, opposition to bondage was limited to battling its extension into the West. Few Republicans advocated ending slavery&#x2014;except in the distant future. Party members roundly rejected abolitionist demands for immediate action. Moreover, most Republicans (like most Northerners) were racists and had little interest in expanding the rights of free blacks. Indeed, many Republicans advocated free soil and a prohibition on the emigration to the West of all African Americans, free and slave. Blocking the spread of slavery was an important stance and one that frightened many in the South. But this position must not be equated with a humanitarian concern for the plight of African Americans. For most Republicans nonextension was more an economic policy designed to secure Northern domination of Western lands than the initial step in a broad plan to end slavery.<br>Nor does a celebration of the &#x201c;battle cry of freedom&#x201d; fairly characterize Republican goals once fighting began: the party i</p><h2>Family Britain, 1951-1957</h2><p><p>As in his highly acclaimed <i>Austerity Britain</i>, David Kynaston invokes an astonishing array of vivid, intimate and unselfconscious voices to drive his narrative of 1950s Britain. The keen-eyed Nella Last shops assiduously at Barrow Market as austerity and rationing gradually give way to relative abundance; housewife Judy Haines, relishing the detail of suburban life, brings up her children in Chingford; the self-absorbed civil servant Henry St John perfects the art of grumbling. These and many other voices give a rich, unsentimental picture of everyday life in the 1950s. Well-known figures are encountered on the way, such as Doris Lessing (joining and later leaving the Communist Party), John Arlott (sticking up on <i>Any Questions?</i> for the rights of homosexuals) and <i>Tiger</i>'s Roy of the Rovers (making his goal-scoring debut for Melchester).</p><p>All this is part of a colourful, unfolding tapestry, in which the great national events - the Tories returning to power, the death of George VI, the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth, the Suez Crisis - jostle alongside everything that gave Britain in the 1950s its distinctive flavour: Butlin's holiday camps, Kenwood food mixers, <i>Hancock's Half-Hour</i>, Ekco television sets, Davy Crockett, skiffle and teddy boys. Deeply researched, David Kynaston's <i>Family Britain</i> offers an unrivalled take on a largely cohesive, ordered, still very hierarchical society gratefully starting to move away from the painful hardships of the 1940s towards domestic ease and affluence.</p></p><p><p>David Kynaston was born in Aldershot in 1951. He has been a professional historian since 1973 and has written fifteen books, including <i>The City of London </i>(1994-2001), a widely acclaimed four-volume history, and <i>W.G.'s Birthday Party, </i>an account of the Gentleman vs. the Players at Lord's in July 1898. He is the author of <i>Austerity Britain, 1945-51</i>, the first title in a series of books covering the history of post-war Britain (1945-1979) under the collective title 'Tales of a New Jerusalem'. He is currently a visiting professor at Kingston University.</p><p>&#x201c;Kyanston has again written a masterpiece.

Jazz, racy fashions, eyebrowraising new attitudes about art and sex&#x2015;all of this pointed to a sleek, modern world, one that could shake off the grimness of the Great War and stride into the future in one deft, stylized gesture. The women who defined this the Jazz Age&#x2015;Josephine Baker, Tallulah Bankhead, Diana Cooper, Nancy Cunard, Zelda Fitzgerald, and Tamara de Lempicka&#x2015;would presage the sexual revolution by nearly half a century and would shape the role of women for generations to come.<br>In <i>Flappers</i>, the acclaimed biographer Judith Mackrell renders these women with all the color that marked their lives and their era. Both sensuous and sympathetic, her admiring biography lays bare the private lives of her heroines, filling in the bold contours. These women came from vastly different backgrounds, but all ended up passing through Paris, the mecca of the avant-garde. Before she was the toast of Parisian society, Josephine Baker was a poor black girl from the slums of Saint Louis. Tamara de Lempicka fled the Russian Revolution only to struggle to scrape together a life for herself and her family. A committed painter, her portraits were indicative of the age's art deco sensibility and sexual daring. The Brits in the group&#x2015;Nancy Cunard and Diana Cooper&#x2015; came from pinkie-raising aristocratic families but soon descended into the salacious delights of the vanguard. Tallulah Bankhead and Zelda Fitzgerald were two Alabama girls driven across the Atlantic by a thirst for adventure and artistic validation.</p><p>But beneath the flamboyance and excess of the Roaring Twenties lay age-old prejudices about gender, race, and sexuality. These flappers weren't just dancing and carousing; they were fighting for recognition and dignity in a male-dominated world. They were more than mere lovers or muses to the modernist masters&#x2015;in their pursuit of fame and intense experience, we see a generation of women taking bold steps toward something burgeoning, undefined, maybe dangerous: a New Woman.</p></p><p><b>Judith Mackrell</b> is a celebrated dance critic, writing first for <i>The Independent</i> and now for <i>The Guardian</i>.

It was barely four miles from her family&#x2019;s Mayfair home to the hospital in Southwark, yet Diana was conscious that, to her distraught mother sitting in the car beside her, it was a journey into the wilderness. <br>During tearfully protracted arguments Diana had tried to convince her mother that enlisting as a VAD (member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment) was not a lone, wilful act. Among the thousands of women who were queuing to serve their country, a number were Diana&#x2019;s own friends, and some were volunteering for much more arduous duties: driving ambulances, working in munitions factories or nursing at the Front. <br>Yet to the Duchess of Rutland, the idea of her daughter working in one of London&#x2019;s public hospitals, making tea and washing patients, was barely less squalid than her volunteering to walk the streets as a prostitute. As the family Rolls-Royce crossed Southwark Bridge and began to nose its way through grimy cobbled streets, jostled by crowds, assailed by smells from the docks and from the piles of festering rubbish, the Duchess&#x2019;s worst fears seemed justified. Years later Diana could still recall the detail of that stiff, silent drive. The dark drizzle spattering against the car&#x2019;s windscreen; the stricken expression on her mother&#x2019;s face; the momentary faltering of her own courage as they pulled up outside the gaunt, grey fa�ade of Guy&#x2019;s. <br>It was not a welcoming scene. A huddle of nurses was crossing the wide courtyard, heads bowed against the blustery wind, skirts whipped around their legs. Equally drear was the expression worn by the elderly housekeeper as she opened the door and led the way silently upstairs to the room where Diana was to sleep. There was nothing as frivolous as a full-length mirror among its bare furnishings, yet as she changed into her nurse&#x2019;s uniform the look in her mother&#x2019;s eyes told Diana that, to the Duchess at least, she appeared hideous. <br>She felt guilty at the pain she was causing, but she was exhilarated, too. Even though the collar of her mauve and white striped dress was starched to a punitive stiffness and the coarse, regulation cotton felt harsh after the chiffon and silk to which she was accustomed, these discomforts brought a sense of transformation. When Diana tied her shoelaces and tightened her belt it was with the knowledge that for the first time in twenty-two years she was asserting some control over her life. <br>Apart from the death of her older brother Haddon when she was two, and the misery of being confined to bed when she was ten by a rare form of muscular atrophy,* Diana had known little beyond family parties, seaside holidays and servants whilst growing up. But there were constraints as well as privileges. Her family&#x2019;s expectation that she would marry into money and rank required the dowry of an unblemished reputation, and even when she regarded herself as adult, every hour of her waking life remained, theoretically, under scrutiny. She wasn&#x2019;t permitted to spend a night away from home, except at the house parties of approved friends; she wasn&#x2019;t supposed to walk by herself in the street, nor dine alone with a man. She&#x2019;d developed a hundred ways of dodging her chaperones and keeping certain activities secret, yet such deceit had long ceased to be amusing. It was simply demeaning. <br>Life at Guy&#x2019;s would be very hard, with long days of menial drudgery hedged around with dozens of petty restrictions. But still it spelled deliverance. Not only would Diana be living away from home for the first time, but during her precious off-duty hours she would be free to do what she wanted and see whomever she chose. <br>This hunger for independence was shared by many of the other 46,000 British women who signed up to become VADs,* and by millions of others around the world. When the European powers declared war they inadvertently held out to women a momentous promise of freedom. The American journalist Mabel Potter Daggett spoke too optimistically and too soon when she declared, &#x2018;We may write it down in history that on August 4, 1914 the door of the Doll&#x2019;s House opened&#x2019;, but for many that was the great expectation and the hope.1In Britain, the flood of recruits to the Volunteer Aid Detachment was a phenomenon of enormous interest to the press, with stories and photographs of the richest and most beautiful regularly featured in society columns. And Diana would rapidly become one of the most prominent. She seemed to the public to be practically a princess, having been born to one of the oldest families in Britain (the Rutland title dated back to 1525, the Crawford title on her mother&#x2019;s side to 1398), and also to one of the richest. In 1906, when her father, Sir Henry Manners, had inherited his dukedom, he took possession not only of thousands of acres of land, but of country houses, farms, coal mines and dozens of entire villages. <br>The idea of Diana emerging from this palatial life to nurse the poor and wounded was enormously appealing to the British, and throughout the war she was showcased in many, mistily sentimental press photos. D.W. Griffiths featured her in his 1918 propaganda film <i>Hearts of the World</i> because, he said, she was &#x2018;the most beloved woman in England&#x2019;;2 she was enshrined in a wartime adaptation of the music-hall song &#x2018;Burlington Bertie&#x2019; with the lines, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll eat a banana/With Lady Diana/Aristocracy working at Guys.&#x2019; <br>Yet even more fascinating to the public than Diana&#x2019;s ancestry was her life as a socialite. Ever since she had come out as a debutante in 1910, the suppers and nightclubs she attended, the outfits she wore and the amusing chitchat attributed to her were regularly reported in magazines like <i>The Lady</i> and in the gossip columns of the press. Her reputation extended far beyond London: the <i>Aberdeen Journal</i> confidently informed its readers that &#x2018;no fancy dress ball was complete without the presence of Lady Diana&#x2019; and across the Atlantic, the <i>New York American</i> described her as a necessary embellishment to smart and artistic circles.3Diana&#x2019;s originality, her perceived cleverness and beauty were all that her mother Violet had hoped for. Despite her public commitment to family tradition, the Duchess had artistic, almost bohemian instincts, which she had passed on to her daughters. If Diana, in 1914, was restless for a life beyond her allotted destiny, it was her mother who was partly responsible. <br>As a young woman Violet had been a willowy beauty, the dark, pooling intensity of eyes and the pale auburn cloud of her hair lending her a dreamy, otherworldly distinction. She was sympathetic to the Aesthetic movement in dress, disdaining the elaboration of bustles and puffed sleeves for a simpler style of gown, and affecting a Romantic spontaneity, with lace scarves fluttering at her neck and wrists, posies of wild flowers pinned to her waist, the family tiara worn back to front to hold up her mass of hair. She was clever about the things that concerned her. As a key member of a group of late nineteenth-century intellectuals, nicknamed &#x2018;the Souls&#x2019;*, Violet talked about art and berated the philistinism of the Victorian age. She was also much admired for her own amateur gifts, with several of her busts and her silver-point and pencil portraits exhibited in London galleries. <br>A reputation for being different, even mildly rebellious, had attached itself to her. While Violet deferred to the formal duties of a Duke&#x2019;s wife, she clearly preferred intimate suppers to grand dinners and court events. More subversively still she counted actors like Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree and his wife Maud among her intimate friends. Even at the beginning of the twentieth century, this was odd behaviour for a duchess. However elevated the Trees might be within their profession, they were still theatre people, whose circle had included the scandalous Oscar Wilde. Lord and Lady Salisbury, who lived one door away from the Manners&#x2019; London home, in Arlington Street, were certainly wary of moral contagion. They refused to let their children visit the house, because of the &#x2018;foreign actresses and people like that&#x2019; who might be encountered there.4In the raising of her three daughters &#x2013; Marjorie, Violet (Letty) and Diana &#x2013; Violet also raised eyebrows: she took the girls on regular trips to the London theatre and encouraged in them a precocious independence of spirit. Diana, the youngest, had been born in August 1892 and for several years had been a plain, but interestingly fanciful child. She&#x2019;d imagined herself a &#x2018;necromancer&#x2019;, filling her bedroom with bottles that were &#x2018;coloured and crusted with incandescent sediment from elixiral experiments&#x2019;,5 and because her mother liked &#x2018;only the beautiful in everything&#x2019;6 she&#x2019;d been encouraged in her fancies. The governesses who&#x2019;d educated Diana and her sisters (their brother John was sent off to boarding school) had been instructed to skip over &#x2018;commonplace&#x2019; subjects like mathematics and geography and focus instead on poetry, singing, embroidery and art. <br>History was also favoured, especially family history, and from childhood Diana&#x2019;s imagination had been shaped by stories of her ancestral past and by the imposing enchantment of Belvoir Castle, the Rutland family home. From early childhood she had played among its castellated towers and labyrinthine passage-ways, its vaulted roomfuls of Gobelin tapestries and Dutch paintings.* She had grown up inside a privileged kingdom, buffered by centuries of entitlement. And despite the romantic informality of Violet&#x2019;s influence, the amateur theatricals she organized, the artistic guests she entertained, Diana and her siblings knew both the glamour and the burden of feeling themselves to be a breed apart. <br>By the time she approached her fourteenth birthday Diana had developed into a pretty, spirited teenager, and the clarity of her pale skin and large blue eyes promised she might even become beautiful. That summer she was invited to holiday in Norfolk with the Beerbohm Trees and their three daughters; to her joy, a group of Oxford students were also staying in the same village. Maud and Herbert tolerantly gave permission for shared suppers and picnics, and for three weeks Diana revelled in the company of these clever, good-looking boys. There were games, quizzes and flirtations, during which she &#x2018;showed off madly&#x2019;, and she slipped out to the chemist for a bottle of peroxide to bleach her hair a silvery gold. Even though she felt she was &#x2018;spinning plates&#x2019; in her desperate need to impress, she knew that among these boys she had found her m�tier. <br>Afterwards she wrote to one of them: &#x2018;Brancaster was heavenly, wasn&#x2019;t it. I nearly cried when I left. Do for pity&#x2019;s sake let&#x2019;s all meet again soon&nbsp;&#x2026; When one makes friends, I think one ought to go on being friends hard and not let it drop.&#x2019;7 Further letters were exchanged, there were meetings in the houses of mutual acquaintances and Diana, who had always been so passionately attached to family and home, now hugged to herself the knowledge that she had acquired a circle of her own friends. &#x2018;I wanted first to be loved, and next I wanted to be clever,&#x2019; she recalled, and to make herself worthy of her boys she began begging her mother for lessons in Greek and music,* while alone in her bedroom she practised clever, romantic bon mots in front of her mirror.8 <br>Inspired by vanity and hope, she matured fast. There were appalling blanks in her knowledge (it was left to Iris Tree, four years her junior, to give her the most basic instruction in the facts of life), yet Diana&#x2019;s brain was teeming with poetry, impressions and ideas, and sometimes she could appear obnoxiously forward. One evening, playing after-dinner guessing games with her mother&#x2019;s friends, she grew impatient with the slowness of one of the players. &#x2018;Use your brain, Mr Balfour; use your <i>brain,</i>&#x2019; she snapped at him.9 He was the former prime minister and she was about fifteen. <br>When Diana met Vita Sackville-West at a country house party, she desperately envied the older girl for her literary talent. &#x2018;She is an aristocrat, rollingly rich, who writes French poetry with more ease than I lie on a sofa.&#x2019;10 Feeling that she had no extraordinary gifts of her own, she aimed instead to develop an extraordinary style. At Belvoir she painted her bedroom walls black to contrast with her crimson bedspread; she made artful groupings of candles, religious paintings and dried flowers; she also transformed her clothes. In 1907 &#x2018;all things Greek&#x2019; were in fashion, and dutifully Diana experimented with sandals and draperies, pinning a silver crescent moon in her hair. Dissatisfied with the appearance of her naked feet she tugged hopefully at her second toe, attempting to induce a more &#x2018;Grecian&#x2019; length. Her new bible was <i>L&#x2019;Art et la Mode,</i> the French magazine to which her sisters subscribed, whose pages were filled with the revolutionary designs of Paul Poiret and Mariano Fortuny. <br>With a yearning intentness, she studied pictures of languid female models, their fascinatingly uncorseted bodies draped in silks and diaphanous gowns. She thrilled to the element of theatre in Poiret and Fortuny&#x2019;s clothes, their jewel-bright colours and suggestive flavour of the Orient. Most British girls her age were still aspiring to the fresh and curvy style of the Gibson Girl &#x2013; hair piled high, waist cinched tight to emphasize a full bosom &#x2013; but Diana was determined that her new adult self should be far more avant-garde. <br>Around this time her mother was visited by the playwright Henri Bernstein and his companion Princess Murat. Diana was entranced by the Princess and her stories of sophisticated French society, which were &#x2018;totally different from anything we knew&#x2019;,11 and she was even more entranced by her wardrobe. Obligingly, the Princess allowed Diana to examine her Fortuny dresses, created from brilliantly coloured, exquisitely pleated silk that shimmered to the touch. But what Diana coveted most was the Princess&#x2019;s Poiret-designed tunic, and she was determined to make a copy. It was a simple enough design for Diana&#x2019;s schoolroom sewing skills, and the result was so successful that she made others to sell to her friends, each with a different trim of ribbon, braid or fur. It proved to be a profitable enterprise and Diana squirrelled away the cash she earned: despite the family&#x2019;s ancestral wealth, the Manners children received no pocket money of their own. <br>Diana continued adding to her wardrobe, designing clothes that were sometimes eccentrically experimental, but to her eyes rivetingly modish. As she refashioned her appearance, however, she became self-consciously critical of her figure. These new fluid fashions from Europe were liberating women from the corset, but they followed the line of the body so closely that they imposed a new tyranny. &#x2018;Banting&#x2019; or &#x2018;slenderizing&#x2019; were becoming de rigueur, and when Diana studied herself in the mirror she despaired at the &#x2018;round, white, slow, lazy and generally&nbsp;&#x2026; unappetising blancmange&#x2019; she saw reflected there.12Edwardian Britain was collectively embracing the idea of physical fitness. Cycling, golf, tennis and bathing were much in vogue, part of the brisk tempo of the new century, but Diana&#x2019;s regime of self-improvement was unusually strenuous. She went for long runs around the grounds of Belvoir, jigged furiously to the gramophone &#x2013; a precious acquisition given to her by the opera singer Dame Nellie Melba &#x2013; and pounded away at an old punch bag. The following year she discovered a more creative discipline in dancing. London was newly inspired by Isadora Duncan, the radical American dancer who had become as famou...</p><h2>Classic Bible Stories for Jewish Children</h2><p>Twenty-four Old Testament stories about such familiar characters as Noah, Joseph, Moses, David and Goliath, Ruth and Naomi, and Daniel.</p><p>Alfred J.

It picked up the hints of red and gold among the deep green leaves and had them glowing. From somewhere in the woods came a rustling as a rabbit darted back to its burrow, while overhead a bird chirped with an insistent cheerfulness. Clinging to the line of fences along the road were clumps of honeysuckle. The light scent from the few lingering blossoms wafted in the air. In a distant field a farmer and his son harvested the last of the summer hay. The rumble of the baler was steady and distinct.<br><br>Over the mile trek to town only one car passed. Its driver lifted his hand in a salute. Shane waved back. It was good to be home.<br><br>Walking on the grassy shoulder of the road, she plucked a blossom of honeysuckle and, as she had as a child, drew in the fleetingly sweet aroma. When she crushed the flower between her fingers, its fragrance briefly intensified. It was a scent she associated with summer, like barbecue smoke and new grass. But this was summer's end.<br><br>Shane looked forward to fall eagerly, when the mountains would be at their best. Then the colors were breathtaking and the air was clean and crisp. When the wind came, the world would be full of sound and flying leaves. It was the time of woodsmoke and fallen acorns.<br><br>Curiously, she felt as though she'd never been away. She might still have been twenty-one, walking from her grandmother's to Sharpsburg to buy a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread. The busy Baltimore streets, the sidewalks and crowds of the last four years might have been a dream. She might never have spent those four years teaching in an inner-city school, correcting exams and attending faculty meetings.<br><br>Yet four years had passed. Her grandmother's narrow two-story house was now Shane's. The uneven, wooded three acres of land were hers as well. And while the mountains and woods were the same, Shane was not.<br><br>Physically, she looked almost as she had when she had left western Maryland for the job in a Baltimore high school. She was small in height and frame, with a slender figure that had never developed the curves and roundness she'd hoped for. Her face was subtly triangular with its creamy skin touched with warm color. It had been called peaches and cream often enough to make Shane wince. There were dimples that flashed when she smiled, rather than the elegant cheekbones she had wished for. Her nose was small, dusted with freckles, tilted up at the end. Pert. Shane had suffered the word throughout her life.<br><br>Under thin arched brows, her eyes were large and dark. Whatever emotion she felt was mirrored in them. They were rarely cool. Habitually, she wore her hair short, and it curled naturally to frame her face in a deep honey blond. As her temperament was almost invariably happy, her face was usually animated, her small, sculpted mouth tilted up. The adjective used most to describe her was <i>cute. </i>Shane had grown to detest the word, but lived with it. Nothing could be done to alter sharp, vital attractiveness into sultry beauty.<br><br>As she rounded the last curve in the road before coming into town, she had a sudden flash of having done so before&#x2014;as a child, as a teenager, as a girl on the brink of womanhood. It gave her a sense of security and belonging. Nothing in the city had ever given her the simple pleasure of being part of the whole.<br><br>Laughing, she took the final yards at a run, then burst through the door of the general store. The bells jingled fiercely before it slammed shut.<br><br>"Hi!"<br><br>"Hi, yourself." The woman behind the counter grinned at her. "You're out early this morning."<br><br>"When I woke up, I discovered I was out of coffee." Spotting the box of fresh doughnuts on the counter, Shane rolled her eyes and headed for them. "Oh, Donna, cream filled?"<br><br>"Yeah." Donna watched with an envious sigh as Shane chose one and bit into it. For the better part of twenty years, she'd seen Shane eat like a linebacker without gaining an ounce of fat.<br><br>Though they had grown up together, they were as different as night and day. Where Shane was fair, Donna was dark. Shane was small; Donna was tall and well rounded. For most of their lives, Donna had been content to play follower to Shane's leader. Shane was the adventurer. Donna had liked nothing better than to point out all the flaws in whatever plans she was hatching, then wholeheartedly fall in with it.<br><br>"So, how are you settling in?"<br><br>"Pretty well," Shane answered with her mouth full.<br><br>"You've hardly been in since you got back in town."<br><br>"There's been so much to do. Gran couldn't keep the place up the last few years." Both affection and grief came through in her voice. "She was always more interested in her gardening than a leaky roof. Maybe if I had stayed&#x2014;"<br><br>"Oh, now don't start blaming yourself again." Donna cut her off, drawing her straight dark brows together. "You know she wanted you to take that teaching job. Faye Abbott lived to be ninety-four. That's more than a lot of people can hope for. And she was a feisty old devil right to the end."<br><br>Shane laughed. "You're absolutely right. Sometimes I'm sure she's sitting in her kitchen rocker making certain I wash up my dishes at night." The thought made her want to sigh for the childhood that was gone, but she pushed the mood away. "I saw Amos Messner out in the field with his son haying." After finishing off the doughnut, Shane dusted her hands on the seat of her pants. "I thought Bob was in the army."<br><br>"Got discharged last week. He's going to marry a girl he met in North Carolina."<br><br>"No kidding?"<br><br>Donna smiled smugly. It always pleased her, as proprietor of the general store, to be the ears and eyes of the town. "She's coming to visit next month. She's a legal secretary."<br><br>"How old is she?" Shane demanded, testing.<br><br>"Twenty-two."<br><br>Throwing back her head, Shane laughed in delight. "Oh, Donna, you're terrific. I feel as though I've never been away."<br><br>The familiar unrestricted laugh made Donna grin. "I'm glad you're back. We missed you."<br><br>Shane settled a hip against the counter. "Where's Benji?"<br><br>"Dave's got him upstairs." Donna preened a bit, thinking of her husband and son. "Letting that little devil loose down here's only asking for trouble. We'll switch off after lunch."<br><br>"That's the beauty of living on top of your business."<br><br>Finding the opening she had hoped for, Donna pounced on it. "Shane, are you still thinking about converting the house?"<br><br>"Not thinking," Shane corrected. "I'm going to do it." She hurried on, knowing what was about to follow. "There's always room for another small antique shop, and with the museum attached, it'll be distinctive."<br><br>"But it's such a risk," Donna pointed out. The excited gleam in Shane's eyes had her worrying all the more. She'd seen the same gleam before the beginning of any number of outrageous and wonderful plots. "The expense&#x2014;"<br><br>"I have enough to set things up." Shane shrugged off the pessimism. "And most of my stock can come straight out of the house for now. I want to do it, Donna," she went on as her friend frowned at her. "My own place, my own business." She glanced around the compact, well-stocked store. "You should know what I mean."<br><br>"Yes, but I have Dave to help out, to lean on. I don't think I could face starting or managing a business all on my own."<br><br>"It's going to work." Her eyes drifted beyond Donna, fixed on their own vision. "I can already see how it's going to look when I'm finished."<br><br>"All the remodeling."<br><br>"The basic structure of the house will stay the same," Shane countered. "Modifications, repairs." She brushed them away with the back of her hand. "A great deal of it would have to be done if I were simply going to live there."<br><br>"Licenses, permits."<br><br>"I've applied for everything."<br><br>"Taxes."<br><br>"I've already seen an accountant." She grinned as Donna sighed. "I have a good location, a solid knowledge of antiques, and I can re-create every battle of the Civil War."<br><br>"And do at the least provocation."<br><br>"Be careful," Shane warned her, "or I'll give you another rundown on the Battle of Antietam."<br><br>When the bells on the door jingled again, Donna heaved an exaggerated sigh of relief. "Hi, Stu."<br><br>The next ten minutes were spent in light gossiping as Donna rang up and bagged dry goods. It would take little time to catch up on the news Shane had missed over the last four years.<br><br>Shane was accepted as an oddity&#x2014;the hometown girl who had gone to the city and come back with big ideas. She knew that to the older residents of the town and countryside she would always be Faye Abbott's granddaughter. They were a proprietary people, and she was one of their own. She hadn't settled down and married Cy Trainer's boy as predicted, but she was back now.<br><br>"Stu never changes," Donna said when she was alone with Shane again. "Remember in high school when we were sophomores and he was a senior, captain of the football team and the best-looking hunk in a sweaty jersey?"<br><br>"And nothing much upstairs," Shane added dryly.<br><br>"You always did go for the intellectual type. Hey," she continued before Shane could retort, "I might just have one for you."<br><br>"Have one what?"<br><br>"An intellectual. At least that's how he strikes me. He's your neighbor too," she added with a growing smile.<br><br><i>"My </i>neighbor?"<br><br>"He bought the old Farley place. Moved in early last week."<br><br>"The Farley place?" Shane's brows arched, giving Donna the satisfaction of knowing she was announcing fresh news. "The house was all but gutted by the fire. Who'd be fool enough to buy that ramshackle barn of a place?"<br><br>"Vance Banning," Donna told her. "He's from Washington, D.C."<br><br>After considering the implications of this, Shane shrugged. "Well, I suppose it's a choice piece of land even if the house should be condemned." Wandering to a shelf, she selected a pound can of coffee then set it on the counter without checking the price. "I guess he bought it for a tax shelter or something."<br><br>"I don't think so." Donna rang up the coffee and waited while Shane dug bills out of her back pocket. "He's fixing it up."<br><br>"The courageous type." Absently, she pocketed the loose change.<br><br>"All by himself too," Donna added, fussing with the display of candy bars on the counter. "I don't think he has a lot of money to spare. No job."<br><br>"Oh." Shane's sympathies were immediately aroused. The spreading problem of unemployment could hit anyone, she knew. Just the year before, the teaching staff at her school had been cut by three percent.<br><br>"I heard he's pretty handy though," Donna went on. "Archie Moler went by there a few days ago to take him some lumber. He said he's already replaced the old porch. But the guy's got practically no furniture. Boxes of books, but not much else." Shane was already wondering what she could spare from her own collection. She had a few extra chairs... "And," Donna added warmly, "he's wonderful to look at."<br><br>"You're a married woman," Shane reminded her, clucking her tongue.<br><br>"I still like to look. He's tall." Donna sighed. At five foot eight, she appreciated tall men. "And dark with a sort of lived-in face. You know, creases, lots of bone. And shoulders."<br><br>"You always did go for shoulders."<br><br>Donna only grinned. "He's a little lean for my taste, but the face makes up for it. He keeps to himself, hardly says a word."<br><br>"It's hard being a stranger." She spoke from her own experience. "And being out of work too. What do you think&#x2014;"<br><br>Her question was cut off by the jingle of bells. Glancing over, Shane forgot what she had been about to ask.<br><br>He was tall, as Donna had said. In the few seconds they stared at each other, Shane absorbed every aspect of his physical appearance. Lean, yes, but his shoulders were broad, and the arms exposed by the rolled-up shirtsleeves were corded with muscle. His face was tanned, and it narrowed down to a trim, clipped jaw. Thick and straight, his black hair fell carelessly over a high forehead.<br><br>His mouth was beautiful. It was full and sharply sculpted, but she knew instinctively it could be cruel. And his eyes, a clear deep blue, were cool. She was certain they could turn to ice. She wouldn't have called it a lived-in face, but a remote one. There was an air of arrogant distance about him. Aloofness seemed to vie with an inner charge of energy.<br><br>The spontaneous physical pull was unexpected. In the past, Shane had been attracted to easygoing, good-natured men. This man was neither, she knew, but what she felt was undeniable. For a flash, all that was inside her leaned toward him in a knowledge that was as basic as chemistry and as insubstantial as dreams. Five seconds, it could have been no longer. It didn't need to be.<br><br>Shane smiled. He gave her the briefest of acknowledging nods, then walked to the back of the store.<br><br>"So, how soon do you think you'll have the place ready to open?" Donna asked Shane brightly with one eye trained toward the rear of the store.<br><br>"What?" Shane's mind was still on the man.<br><br>"Your place," Donna said meaningfully.<br><br>"Oh, three months, I suppose." She glanced blankly around the store as if she had just come in. "There's a lot of work to do."<br><br>He came back with a quart of milk and set it on the counter, then reached for his wallet. Donna rang it up, shooting Shane a look from under her lashes before she gave him his change. He left the store without having spoken a word.<br><br>"That," Donna announced grandly, "was Vance Banning."<br><br>"Yes." Shane exhaled. "So I gathered."<br><br>"You see what I mean. Great to look at, but not exactly the friendly sort."<br><br>"No." Shane walked toward the door. "I'll see you later, Donna."<br><br>"Shane!" With a half laugh, Donna called after her. "You forgot your coffee."<br><br>"Hmm? Oh, no thanks," she murmured absently. "I'll have a cup later."<br><br>When the door swung shut, Donna stared at it, then at the can of coffee in her hand. "Now what got into her?" she wondered aloud.<br><br>As she walked home, Shane felt confused. Though emotional by nature, she could, when necessary, be very analytical. At the moment, she was dealing with the shock of what had happened to her in a few fleeting seconds. It had been much more than a feminine response to an attractive man.<br><br>She had felt, inexplicably, as though her whole life had been a waiting period for that quick, silent meeting. Recognition. The word came to her out of nowhere. She had recognized him, not from Donna's description, but from some deep inner knowledge of her own needs. <i>This was the man.</i><br><br></p><h2>Mind of an Outlaw: Selected Essays</h2><p><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>THE GLOBE AND MAIL</i></b><br><br>Norman Mailer was one of the towering figures of twentieth-century American letters and an acknowledged master of the essay. <i>Mind of an Outlaw,</i> the first posthumous publication from this outsize literary icon, collects Mailer&#x2019;s most important and representative work in the form that many rank as his most electrifying. <br> &nbsp;<br> As America&#x2019;s foremost public intellectual, Norman Mailer was a ubiquitous presence in our national life&#x2014;on the airwaves and in print&#x2014;for more than sixty years. With his supple mind and pugnacious persona, he engaged society more than any other writer of his generation. The trademark Mailer swagger is much in evidence in these pages as he holds forth on culture, ideology, politics, sex, gender, and celebrity, among other topics. Here is Mailer on boxing, Mailer on Hemingway, Mailer on Marilyn Monroe, and, of course, Mailer on Mailer&#x2014;the one subject that served as the beating heart of all of his nonfiction. <br> &nbsp;<br> From his early essay &#x201c;A Credo for the Living,&#x201d; published in 1948, when the author was twenty-five, to his final writings in the year before his death, Mailer wrestled with the big themes of his times. He was one of the most astute cultural commentators of the postwar era, a swashbuckling intellectual provocateur who never pulled a punch and was rarely anything less than interesting. <i>Mind of an Outlaw</i> spans the full arc of Mailer&#x2019;s evolution as a writer, including such essential pieces as his acclaimed 1957 meditation on hipsters, &#x201c;The White Negro&#x201d;; multiple selections from his seminal collection <i>Advertisements for Myself;</i> and a never-before-published essay on Sigmund Freud.<br> &nbsp;<br> Incendiary, erudite, and unrepentantly outrageous, Norman Mailer was a dominating force on the battlefield of ideas. Featuring an incisive Introduction by Jonathan Lethem, <i>Mind of an Outlaw</i> forms a fascinating portrait of Mailer&#x2019;s intellectual development across the span of his career as well as the preoccupations of a nation in the last half of the American century.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Mind of an Outlaw</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&#x201c;[Mailer&#x2019;s] best and brightest.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Esquire</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;The fifty essays collected in this retrospective volume span sixty-four years and show [Norman] Mailer (1923&#x2013;2007) at his brawny, pugnacious, and egotistical best. . . .

He is the author of more than thirty books.<i> The Castle in the Forest</i>, his last novel, was his eleventh <i>New York Times </i>bestseller. His first novel, <i>The Naked and the Dead</i>, has never gone out of print. His 1968 nonfiction narrative, <i>The Armies of the Night</i>, won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. He won a second Pulitzer for <i>The Executioner&#x2019;s Song</i> and is the only person to have won Pulitzers in both fiction and nonfiction. Five of his books were nominated for National Book Awards, and he won a lifetime achievement award from the National Book Foundation in 2005. Mr. Mailer died in 2007 in New York City.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Jonathan Lethem</b> is the author of eight novels, including most recently <i>Dissident Gardens</i>. A recipient of the MacArthur fellowship, Lethem has published his stories and essays in <i>The New Yorker, Harper&#x2019;s, Rolling Stone, Esquire,</i> and <i>The</i> <i>New York Times,</i> among others. He lives in California.<br><br><b>Phillip Sipiora </b>is a professor of English and film studies at the University of South Florida.

He is a longtime scholar of Norman Mailer and the editor of <i>The Mailer Review</i>.1940s<br><br>A Credo for the Living<br><br>(1948)<br><br>I must admit that I enjoy this opportunity to write a word or two about my own politics. In the thirties it was common enough for authors to send out a barrage of credos and countercredos, but today&#x2014;because, perhaps, this is a period of less hope and greater concentration&#x2014;the tendency has been to pool our efforts in the Progressive Party, and to leave the refinements, the definitions-of-position, to those authors who have deserted the Left to create political parties of three or four members.<br><br>A long sentence, the above. My apologies.<br><br>Now my own politics, naturally, have a certain relation to The Naked and the Dead.<br><br>The Naked and the Dead was a parable. It was a parable about the movement of men through history, and how history operates; and specifically it was a novel about America&#x2019;s destiny and the historical paths America was to follow after the war. (I was a very ambitious young man at the time I wrote it.) It was not a bitter book. It tried to explore the outrageous proportions of cause and effect, of effort and recompense, in a sick society, and in that sense it is a book with a certain grim humor. Its function was not to seek for affirmations, but meanings, and for that reason perhaps it has been called a novel without hope.<br><br>I think actually it is a novel with a great deal of hope. It finds man corrupted, confused to the point of helplessness, but it also finds that there are limits beyond which man cannot be pushed, and it finds that even in man&#x2019;s corruption and sickness there are yearnings and inarticulate strivings for a better world, a life with more dignity.<br><br>I have written these words about &#x201c;hope,&#x201d; because hope moves people politically. Although I do not think that &#x201c;hope&#x201d; has anything to do with the merits of a novel, I think it has a great deal to do with an author&#x2019;s political activity or lack of it.<br><br>Thus, with a delay or two, we come to the credo. I suppose that politically I am an ignorant Marxist. I mean by that a confession that I cannot in all honesty call myself a Marxist when I have read so few of the basic works of Marxist theory. But politically in terms of specific objectives, of specific legislation and specific projects, I am in agreement with a great many tenets of the Left. To focus it more finely I might say that I feel myself to the left of the Progressive Party and to the right of the Communist Party.<br><br>I have come to this station by way of certain basic assumptions. I feel, and this is most directly important, that the need today is to approach &#x201c;issues and questions&#x201d;&#x2014;those ponderous words which are the bane of all leftist writing&#x2014;with an attitude that problems are complex, and their solutions are complex. Out of the swill and the honey which has been strewn over the Soviet Union, it is rarely stated that the USSR is an immense country, and that evaluations of it must be as many-faceted and various as evaluations of the United States.<br><br>A book which saw America through a Negro chain gang in Georgia, or from a nightclub on Fifty-Second Street or from a peaceful farm in Iowa, would be hardly a definitive work on the United States. By the same token almost every approach to the USSR has been that limited and that special. It is my diffident opinion that Russia is neither Arcadia nor a black police state in which every man slaughters his brother. It is an immense nation with wonderful things and bad things, and it is a state which like all states is in the midst of a historical process, and is moving and changing.<br><br>But when the last war ended, it was not Russia which sought to take over Europe by force. It was the United States. A deep revolutionary movement that was spontaneous and natural, and came to being out of the miseries and lessons of the Second World War, was created in Western Europe. Communism was the answer for Western Europe, and it would have been a more satisfactory answer than the mangle of present-day political life there. We opposed it as a nation not because Communism in Europe would have been a threat to America&#x2019;s existence, but because it would have been a threat to the present economic organization of America.<br><br>It is perfectly ridiculous to assume that if Europe had gone Communist, Russia would have engaged in a war with us. Both Russia and the countries of Western Europe would have had their own crucial problems of reconstruction. It would have taken decades, as it may now take centuries, to have restored those countries to healthy productive societies. In the process America would have been influenced by what was occurring in Europe, might gradually and peacefully have oriented itself toward socialism.<br><br>That would have meant the end of the present ruling society in America. And in the instinctive appreciation of a dangerous problem that ruling societies always exhibit, the campaign to identify the Soviet Union with the worst ogres of a nightmare was begun. Its success was a reflection of the neurosis of America.<br><br>America is in a moral wilderness today, torn between a Christian ethic now enfeebled, a capitalist ethic, and a new sexual ethic whose essence is sadistic. When one contemplates the staggering frustrations and animosities of American life, I think there is hope to be found in the fact that there is resistance, and that there is a political party, the Progressive Party, which will poll millions of votes, millions of protests, against the campaign to make America fascist in preference to letting it move socialist.<br><br>My hope for the future depends upon more than those millions of votes. It is heartening for us to remember that the economic rulers of America have their problems too. They have satisfied temporarily the spiritual frustration of America life by feeding Americans upon anti-Russian hysteria. But hatred, except in rare cases, is only a temporary food. The basic problems of Americans, the spiritual problems, remain unsolved, and there is no way short of fascism or war for the present ruling groups to solve those problems.<br><br>There is resistance to fascism, and there is resistance to war. I think it is childish of us to assume that it is impossible for Americans to move toward the Progressive Party. History is filled with waves and counterwaves. My hope and my belief in America is that unlike Germany, there will be more and more resistance created as we move closer to the solution of the fascism and war that the reactionaries will present us.<br><br>In the meantime I will act politically for those things in which I believe. If it will take courage so much the better. We shall all find our courage. The beauty in man is that under the press of circumstances he develops what he must possess.<br><br>1950s<br><br>Freud<br><br>(circa mid-1950s)<br><br>For Freud it was unthinkable not to have a civilization&#x2014;no matter what price must be paid in individual suffering, in neurosis, in the alienation of man from his instincts, the alternative&#x2014;a return to barbarism, to the primitive, was simply beyond the cultural shaping of Freud&#x2019;s life. As a lower-middle-class middle-European Jew who rose in bourgeois society, he was not only the mirror but finally the essence of German culture. It could be argued that the nature of the Jews, the meaning of the Jews, is not to find themselves as a people, but to re-create within themselves, as works of art, the models of a culture which is forever alien to them. So it is possible that the finest understanding of manners, of snobbery, of power, or equally of bourgeois stability can be grasped only by an outsider who can never take such values for granted but must acquire them by imaginative exercises of will, talent, and social courage. Freud was not born to become a respected young neurologist in Viennese medical society at the age of forty; it took the application of his early ambition, the subjugation of a good part of his more rebellious instincts, to acquire the training, the habits, and the manners of a Viennese doctor. No surprise, then, if at the moment of engaging his second career, with that long heroic passage through the underwater currents of the dream, at whose end he was to create no less than the most pervasive religion of the twentieth century, the rational gloomy ethic of psychoanalysis, it was enough to ask of him that he be ready to turn the foundations of Western society into a new view of marriage, family, and man. One could hardly ask for more: that the view be revolutionary, that the search be not for foundations but dynamic. Freud was ready to endanger his security in the bourgeois world [he had attained] in order to save that world&#x2014;his unadmitted love was always for the middle class, but it was simply not within the bounds of one hero to wreak two upheavals upon thought. Society was sick, Freud could see it, but of necessity the answer for him was to redefine the nature of man in such a way as to keep society intact and Freud in his study and consulting room. If civilization was top-heavy in its structures and institutions, and instinct was therefore crippled in its expression, and able to achieve beauty (melancholy beauty, be it said) only through sublimation, then so it must be. Man, for whatever reason, and the ultimate reason was mysterious&#x2014;Freud had no flair for the mystical&#x2014;man for whatever reason must accept himself as a crippled being who could become less crippled but never whole&#x2014;in return his civilization would presumably evolve and become less tragic. But it was a spartan view. In return for austerity, and pure psychoanalysis was austere, severe, unrelenting (as opposed to the more amiable and friendly varieties which proliferate in a pleasure-loving America today), man would at least be given the dignity of maintaining his civilization. How middle-class and Jewish this is can hardly be exaggerated. Part of the paradox in Freud&#x2019;s style of mind was that he was capable of the finest intellectual distinctions, and the subtlest engagements of the opposite point of view in debate, while possessing almost no original capacity as a philosopher. At a very high level, he is the Jewish businessman raised to apotheosis, [even to the cigar,] and the sum of his philosophy in a depressed state could come to not much more than the heavy sigh of: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never had a particularly good time in my life, and the world is dog eat dog, but I&#x2019;ve raised a family and I&#x2019;ve taken care of them, and who knows, the kids never listen to the parents anyway, but maybe they&#x2019;ll make a better world, although I doubt it. The big thing is to do your duty, &#x2019;cause otherwise it would all be chaos. I mean, where would we be if everybody went around doing what they wanted to do?&#x201d;<br><br>This gloomy view could be maintained in Freud&#x2019;s time, at least until the First World War; afterward, Freud&#x2019;s sense of the possibilities darkened further, his speculative toe entered the new deep waters of mysticism as Thanatos was added to Eros, the death instinct engaged in a dialectic with libido. But mysticism is the executioner of the middle-class ethic. The stability of the bourgeois has always depended upon a schizophrenic separation of the power of religion-as-an-institution from religion as a personal revelation of Heaven, Hell, Eternity, the soul, God, and human destiny. Mysticism has the nasty faculty of joining one&#x2019;s public and private life, it presents as its ultimate threat the subordination of reason to instinct, even as society rules instinct by reason. Freud was the last genius of twentieth-century society, only the epigones have followed. And as he was dying in 1939, the wreckage of his world was about him, the last engineer of civilization was hearing the bulkheads blow as he went under into that dark night about which he had refused to speculate.<br><br>And a dark night it was, because the war upon instinct which was the progressive rationale of the nineteenth century, the&#x2014;for so long it seemed victorious&#x2014;achievement of the Victorian period, was blown beyond recognition in the concentration camps and the atomic bomb. The dam of civilization burst before pent-up floods of instinct, and even as gates were carried away in the wash, so the crippling irony remained, the debris of civilization dissolved into the instinct, and altered the language of instinct; men were not murdered by the million but liquidated, atomic residue was not a slow fatality but a fallout. Perhaps it is better to use Freud&#x2019;s image of the rider and the steed, reason controlling instinct, superego the reins, id the horse, and the rider as ego encouraging or punishing the separate heats of the animal. By that image, the wildness of the horse is controlled at the expense of the horseman&#x2019;s fatigue, but one goes where one wishes to go, if not always at the desired rate. This was the central image of Freud&#x2019;s psychology, civilization mounted upon the noble savage, but the results were unexpected. For the animal was controlled not a little too much but incommensurately too much, and as it came closer to death, so the horse went wild and headed for a cliff. But the rider was also insane, his fatigue was equally cruel, horse and rider had never been suited to one another, and in the gallop to the cliff, the rider was using his spurs, not his reins, they are at the moment of danger of leaping over together, each of them poisoned, berserk with frustration.<br><br>With Freud&#x2019;s love for the English, the idea must have been that somehow one would muddle through.<br><br>It would not be worth saying Freud had an umbilical respect for the meanings of anxiety and dread, if it were not that his disciples have reduced these concepts to alarm bells and rattles of malfunction in a psychic machine. Anxiety and dread are treated by them as facts, as the clashing of gears in a neurotic net. The primitive understanding of dread&#x2014;that one was caught in a dialogue with gods, devils, and spirits, and so was naturally consumed with awe, shame, and terror, has been all but forgotten. We are taught that we feel anxiety because we are driven by unconscious impulses which are socially unacceptable; dread we are told is a repetition of infantile experiences of helplessness. It is induced in us by situations which remind our unconscious of weaning and other early deprivations. What is never discussed: the possibility that we feel anxiety because we are in danger of losing some part or quality of soul unless we act, and not dangerously; or the likelihood that we feel dread when intimations of our death inspire us with disproportionate terror, a horror not merely because we are going to die, but to the contrary because we are going to die badly and suffer some unendurable stricture of eternity.</p><h2>BJU Press Spelling 3 Worktext</h2><p>Spelling 3 Student Worktext (2nd Edition Copyright Update)</p><p></p><h2>Diary of a Superfluous Man</h2><p><p><strong>A vivid picture of nineteenth-century Russian society, but above all the poignant story of a man whose mortality becomes the only aspect of life that he shares with his fellow man.</strong></p> When Turgenev published <em>Diary of a Superfluous Man</em> in 1850, he created one of the first literary portraits of the alienated man.

Daniel Goleman argues that our view of human intelligence is far too narrow, and that our emotions play major role in thought, decision making and individual success. Self-awareness, impulse control, persistence, motivation, empathy and social deftness are all qualities that mark people who excel: whose relationships flourish, who are stars in the workplace. With new insights into the brain architecture underlying emotion and rationality, Goleman shows precisely how emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened in all of us.</p><p>The Western cultures esteem analytical skills measured by IQ tests: but there is clearly more to success and happiness, even in technological societies, than IQ alone. Goleman has written one of the best books on the nature and importance of other kinds of intelligence besides our perhaps overly beloved IQ. Recommended.Everyone knows that high IQ is no guarantee of success, happiness, or virtue, but until the discoveries of modern brain researchers, theorists could only guess why. Daniel Goleman's fascinating report from the frontiers of psychology and neuroscience offers us startling new insight into our "two minds" -- the rational and the emotional -- and how they together shape our destiny. Beginning deep in the brain, <i>Emotional Intelligence</i> shows us the exact mechanism of an "emotional hijack," when passion overcomes reason. Through vivid examples, Goleman then delineates the crucial skills of emotional intelligence, and shows how they determine our success in relationships and work, and even our physical well-being. What emerges is a crucial new way to talk about being smart. The final chapters reveal the possibilities -- and limits -- of "emotional literary," as it is taught by both parents and educators. The book concludes with a compelling vision of what true emotional intelligence means for us both as individuals and as a society. The message of this eye-opening book is one we must take to heart: the true "bell curve" for a democracy must measure emotional intelligence.

His witty, conversational narrative transports us from the 1960s to the near present, from starkly erotic scenes in the back rooms of New York clubs to episodes of rarefied hilarity in the salons of Paris to moments of family truth in the American Midwest. Along the way, a breathtaking variety of personal connections--and near misses--slowly builds an awareness of the transformative power of genuine friendship, of love and loss, culminating in an indelible experience with a dying man. And as the flow of memory carries us across time, space and society, one man's magnificently realized story grows to encompass an entire generation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Sublimely funny yet elegiac, full of unsparingly trenchant social observation yet infused with wisdom and a deeply felt compassion, The Farewell Symphony is a triumph of reflection and expressive elegance. It is also a stunning and wholly original panorama of gay life over the past thirty years--the crowning achievement of one of our finest writers.</p><p>Edmund White has long been praised as one of America's most accomplished novelists. <i>The Farewell Symphony</i> is the final volume in the autobiographical trilogy that began with <i>A Boy's Own Story</i> and <i>The Beautiful Room Is Empty</i>. It details the narrator's life in New York in the 1970s and his flight to Paris as the AIDS epidemic begins. White's prose, at once lucid and magical, is the essence of great writing. Its plainspoken cadences and language resonate with the tragedy of youthful passion giving way to hard-earned knowledge. Like Sherwood Anderson or Theodore Dreiser, White has captured the soul of the American experience--in this case a gay male experience--and made it into art.Edmund White was born in Cincinnati in 1940. He has taught literature and creative writing at Yale, Johns Hopkins, New York University and Columbia, was a full professor of English at Brown and served as executive director of the New York Institute for the Humanities. In 1983 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Award for Literature from the National Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1993 he was made a Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et Lettres. For his last book, <b>Genet: A Biography</b> (1993), he was awarded the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Lambda Literary Award. His other books include <b>Forgetting Elena, Nocturnes for the King of Naples, States of Desire: Travels in Gay America, A Boy's Own Story, Caracole</b> and <b>The Beautiful Room Is Empty.</b> He lives in Paris.</p><h2>On Empire: America, War, and Global Supremacy</h2><p>In there four incisive and keenly perceptive essays, one of out most celebrated and respected historians of modern Europe looks at the world situation and some of the major political problems confronting us at the start of the third millennium.<br><br>With his usual measured and brilliant historical perspective, Eric Hobsbawm traces the rise of American hegemony in the twenty-first century. He examines the state of steadily increasing world disorder in the context of rapidly growing inequalities created by rampant free-market globalization. He makes clear that there is no longer a plural power system of states whose relations are governed by common laws--including those for the conduct of war. He scrutinizes America's policies, particularly its use of the threat of terrorism as an excuse for unilateral deployment of its global power. Finally, he discusses the ways in which the current American hegemony differs from the defunct British Empire in its inception, its ideology, and its effects on nations and individuals.<br><br>Hobsbawm is particularly astute in assessing the United States' assertion of world hegemony, its denunciation of formerly accepted international conventions, and its launching of wars of aggression when it sees fit. Aside from the naivete and failure that have surrounded most of these imperial campaigns, Hobsbawm points out that foreign values and institutions--including those associated with a democratic government--can rarely be imposed on countries such as Iraq by outside forces unless the conditions exist that make them acceptable and readily adaptable.<br><br>Timely and accessible, <i>On Empire</i> is a commanding work of history that should be read by anyone who wants some understanding of the turbulent times in which we live.</p><p>Eric Hobsbawm is a fellow of the British Academy and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has taught at the University of London, the College de France, MIT, Cornell. and the Graduate Faculty of The New School for Social Research. He is the author of more than twenty books. He lives in London.<b>On the End of Empires</b><br><br>When I was born, all Europeans lived in states which were part of empires in the traditional monarchical or the nineteenth-century colonial sense of the world, except the citizens of Switzerland, the three Scandinavian states, and the former dependencies of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans&#x2014;and some of these had left the Ottoman Empire only just before the First World War. The inhabitants of Africa lived under empires almost without exception, and so, without any exception, did the inhabitants of the Pacific and Southeast Asian islands, large and small. But for the fact that the ancient Chinese Empire had come to an end some six years before I was born, one might have said that all the countries of Asia were parts of empires, old and new, except perhaps Thailand (then known as Siam) and Afghanistan, maintaining a sort of independence between rival European powers. Only the Americas south of the United States consisted primarily of states which neither had nor were colonial dependencies, even though they were certainly economically and culturally dependent.<br><br>In the course of my lifetime all this has gone. The First World War broke the Habsburg Empire into fragments and completed the breakup of the Ottoman Empire. But for the October Revolution, this would also have been the fate of the empire of the Russian tsar, though it was severely weakened, as was the German Empire, which lost both the imperial title and its colonies. The Second World War destroyed the imperial potential of Germany, which had been briefly realized under Adolf Hitler. It destroyed the colonial empires of the imperialist era, great and small, the British, French, and Japanese, the Dutch and Portuguese, the Belgian, and what little remained of the Spanish. Incidentally, it also brought the end of the relatively brief U.S. excursion into formal colonialism on the European model, in the Philippines and a few other territories. Finally, at the end of the last century, the collapse of European communist regimes brought to an end both Russia as a single multinational entity as it had existed under the tsars and the more short-lived Soviet Empire in East and Central Europe. The metropoles have lost their power, as they have lost their dependencies. Only one potential imperial power remains.<br><br>Thirty years ago, most of us welcomed this dramatic change in the political face of the globe, as many of us still do. However, today we look back on it from a troubled new century that seems to lack the relative order and predictability of the Cold War era. The era of empires has gone, but so far nothing has effectively replaced it. The number of independent states has quadrupled since 1913, most of them the debris of former empires, but while in theory we now live in the world of free nation-states which, according to Presidents Wilson and Roosevelt, was to replace the world of empires, in practice we live in what we can now recognize as a deeply unstable form of global disorder both internationally and within states. A number&#x2014;probably a growing number&#x2014;of these political entities appear incapable of carrying on the essential functions of territorial states or are threatened with disintegration by secessionist movements. What is more, since the end of the Cold War we live in an era when uncontrollable or barely controllable armed conflict has become endemic in large areas of Asia, Africa, Europe, and parts of the Pacific. Massacre amounting to genocide and the mass expulsion of populations (&#x201c;ethnic cleansing&#x201d;) are once again taking place on a scale not seen since the years immediately following World War II. Can we wonder that in some countries the survivors of former empires regret their passing?<br><br>How should these empires be remembered? The nature of official and popular memory depends to some extent on the length of time that has elapsed since an empire&#x2019;s disappearance and whether it has left any inheritors. The Roman Empire, both in its western and eastern form, was so completely destroyed, and destroyed so long ago, that it has no inheritor, though the mark it has left on the world, even outside the area it once occupied, is enormous. Alexander&#x2019;s is gone forever, and so is Genghis Khan&#x2019;s and Timur&#x2019;s. So are the empires of the Umayyads and Abbasids. More recently, the Habsburg Empire was so completely destroyed in 1918, and was so completely a-national in structure, that it has no effective continuity with the small nation-state now called Austria. However, often there is some continuity, especially as the end of so many empires is so recent, and has usually been accompanied or followed, in the former metropolitan states, by periods of considerable political and psychological stress. True, today no state that once ruled over a colonial empire intends to, or has any hope of, restoration. But where the metropoles of former empires survive as effective states, usually as nation-states, there is a tendency among them after a while to look back on the times of past greatness with pride and nostalgia. There is also an understandable temptation to exaggerate the benefits which the empire is said to have conferred on its subjects while it existed, such as the law and order within its territories and, with more justification, the fact that several (but not all) vanished empires have been more tolerant of ethnic, linguistic, and religious multiplicity than the nation-states that succeeded them. Nevertheless, as a writer on empires points out, reviewing Professor Mazower&#x2019;s remarkable social history <i>Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews, 1430&#x2013;1950</i>, &#x201c;this theory of empire is too good to be true. . . .&#x201d;[1] The reality of empires should not be in the hands of selective nostalgia.<br><br>Only one collective form of imperial memory has practical implications today. This is the feeling that the superior power of empires to conquer and rule the world was based on superior civilization, easily identified with moral or even racial superiority. In the nineteenth century both tended to go together, but the historical experience of Nazi Germany has eliminated racial or ethnic claims to superiority from polite discourse. However, the tacit rather than openly articulated Western claim of moral superiority remains, and finds expression in the conviction that our values and institutions are superior to others&#x2019; and may, or even should, be imposed on them to their benefit, if necessary by force of arms.<br>NOTES<br>[1] Jan Morris, "Islam's Lost Grandeur," review of <i>Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims, and Jews, 1430-1950</i>, by Mark Mazower.

The watercolor-and-pencil illustrations are soft, inviting, and appealing to the senses. They invite the eye to focus on small details, such as the close-up of sandals kicked off in the sand. The book is in landscape, highlighting the horizontal nature of the beach. The page layout is steady throughout, producing a sense of profound calm and quiet joy. Each spread includes an American Sign Language diagram for a word in the text, framed by a sketch of shells, sand dollars, and other seashore motifs. A small centered square of text in verse hovers in the white space. "Take my hands/And dance me dizzy/Swing me around/Fly me to the dunes." Opposite are the painterly, tactile, almost cloudlike, warmly hued illustrations of the outing, from sunup to sundown. The only drawback to this poetic summertime story is that a couple of signs are not accurately illustrated or commonly used. For example, "hand" is signed not palms down, but palms facing the body, at chest level. Nevertheless, the book is recommended for libraries with an interest in ASL, and those in need of beach-themed picture books for the mommy-and-me crowd.&#x2014;Sara Lissa Paulson, The American Sign Language and English Lower School, New York City</p><h2>Embodiments: Masterworks of African Figurative Sculpture</h2><p>This volume, on a unique and wide-ranging collection of figural sculptures from sub-Saharan Africa, examines not only each distinctive piece, but also how these works of art express value systems and cultural relationships both inside and outside Africa. The Richard H. Scheller Collection, presented in this book and on display at the de Young in San Francisco, offers a diverse portrait of sub-Saharan African sculpture. More than 100 distinct ethnic groups from more than 20 present-day countries are represented by works of art spanning several centuries and encompassing a broad array of styles. These objects represent ancestors, express community values, and serve religious and ceremonial purposes. Beautifully photographed in natural light, the sculptures range in style from classic and iconic to rare and unusual. The geographical breadth of the collection and the variations in the depictions will allow readers to explore both the histories and formal qualities of the genre. Texts by leading scholars enhance the understanding of 122 objects, alongside essays on major sculptures and themes. Writings on the scientific testing of pieces and the process of photographing the works round out this volume that expands our understanding of African figurative art.</p><p>Christina Hellmich is Curator in Charge of the Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas and the Jolika Collection of New Guinea art at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.

When he died ninety years later, the company he built stood at the top of a global industry, with the Ferrari name universally recognized for performance, racing prowess, and state-of-the-art Italian design. <i>Enzo Ferrari: Power, Politics, and the Making of an Automotive Empire</i> is the definitive account of an epic life. <p><br>Drawing on years of original research conducted in Italy and abroad, author and Ferrari insider, Luca Dal Monte, uncovers a wealth of new facts about Enzo's origins, ambitions, business practices, and private life. The book revisits all the highlights of Ferrari's rise to greatness: his driving career in the 1920s; his management of racing teams for Alfa Romeo in the 1930s; the launch of his own company and team in the late 1940s, and his unprecedented successes building cars for the road and race track in the following decades. But the book also examines lesser-known and sometimes hidden aspects of Ferrari's career, from his earliest failed business ventures to his political dealings with Italy's Fascist government, Allied occupiers, and even Communist leaders. And it lays bare the internal politics of the Ferrari company and team, whose leader manipulated employees, drivers, competitors and the media with a volatile mixture of brute force, paranoia, and guile. </p><p><br>Accompanying the in-depth text are extensive endnotes along with a full bibliography and index.

All have been bestsellers.<b>C H A P T E R 2</b><br>Reacher was on his way to them because of a woman. He had spent Friday night in South Beach, Miami, in a salsa club, with a dancer from a cruise ship. The boat was Norwegian, and so was the girl. Reacher guessed she was too tall for ballet, but she was the right size for everything else. They met on the beach in the afternoon. Reacher was working on his tan. He felt better brown. He didn&#x2019;t know what she was working on. But he felt her shadow fall across his face and opened his eyes to find her staring at him. Or maybe at his scars. The browner he got, the more they stood out, white and wicked and obvious. She was pale, in a black bikini. A <i>small </i>black bikini. He pegged her for a dancer long before she told him. It was in the way she held herself. <br><br>They ended up having a late dinner together and then going out to the club. South Beach salsa wouldn&#x2019;t have been Reacher&#x2019;s first choice, but her company made it worthwhile. She was fun to be with. And she was a great dancer, obviously. Full of energy. She wore him out. At four in the morning she took him back to her hotel, eager to wear him out some more. Her hotel was a small Art Deco place near the ocean. Clearly the cruise line treated its people well. Certainly it was a much more romantic destination than Reacher&#x2019;s own motel. And much closer. <br><br>And it had cable television, which Reacher&#x2019;s place didn&#x2019;t. He woke at eight on Saturday morning when he heard the dancer in the shower. He turned on the TV and went looking for ESPN. He wanted Friday night&#x2019;s American League highlights. He never found them. He clicked his way through successive channels and then stopped dead on CNN because he heard the chief of an Indiana police department say a name he knew: <i>James Barr. </i>The picture was of a press conference. Small room, harsh light. Top of the screen was a caption that said: <i>Courtesy NBC. </i>There was a banner across the bottom that said: <i>Friday Night Massacre. </i>The police chief said the name again, <i>James Barr, </i>and then he introduced a homicide detective called Emerson. Emerson looked tired. Emerson said the name for a third time: <i>James Barr. </i>Then, like he anticipated the exact question in Reacher&#x2019;s mind, he ran through a brief biography: <i>Forty-one years old, local Indiana resident, U.S. Army infantry specialist from 1985 to 1991, Gulf War veteran, never married, currently unemployed.<br></i><br>Reacher watched the screen. Emerson seemed like a concise type of a guy. He was brief. No bullshit. He finished his statement and in response to a reporter&#x2019;s question declined to specify what if anything James Barr had said during interrogation. Then he introduced a District Attorney. This guy&#x2019;s name was Rodin, and he wasn&#x2019;t concise. Wasn&#x2019;t brief. He used plenty of bullshit. He spent ten minutes claiming Emerson&#x2019;s credit for himself. Reacher knew how <i>that </i>worked. He had been a cop of sorts for thirteen years. Cops bust their tails, and prosecutors bask in the glory. Rodin said <i>James Barr </i>a few more times and then said the state was maybe looking to fry him.<br><br>For what?<br><br>Reacher waited.<br><br>A local anchor called Ann Yanni came on.

A suspect in custody, but a city still grieving.<br><br>Reacher thought it was Yanni who was grieving. Emerson&#x2019;s success had cut her story short. She signed off and CNN went to political news. Reacher turned the TV off. The dancer came out of the bathroom. She was pink and fragrant. And naked. She had left her towels inside.<br><br>&#x201c;What shall we do today?&#x201d; she said, with a wide Norwegian smile.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to Indiana,&#x201d; Reacher said.<br>He walked north in the heat to the Miami bus depot. Then he leafed through a greasy timetable and planned a route. It wasn&#x2019;t going to be an easy trip. Miami to Jacksonville would be the first leg. Then Jacksonville to New Orleans. Then New Orleans to St. Louis. Then St. Louis to Indianapolis. Then a local bus, presumably, south into the heartland. Five separate destinations. Arrival and departure times were not well integrated. Beginning to end, it was going to take more than forty-eight hours. He was tempted to fly or rent a car, but he was short of money and he liked buses better and he figured nothing much was going to happen on the weekend anyway.<br><br>What happened on the weekend was that Rosemary Barr called her firm&#x2019;s investigator back.

He&#x2019;s in intensive care with a bunch of prison deadbeats. They&#x2019;ve got him handcuffed to the bed. He&#x2019;s in a <i>coma, </i>for God&#x2019;s sake.

So he&#x2019;s <i>theirs. </i>He&#x2019;s in the system. Like a twilight zone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What would you like to happen?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He shouldn&#x2019;t be in handcuffs. And he should be in a VA hospital at least. But that won&#x2019;t happen until I find a lawyer who&#x2019;s prepared to help him.&#x201d;<br><br>Franklin paused. &#x201c;How do you explain all the evidence?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know my brother.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You moved out, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For other reasons. Not because he&#x2019;s a homicidal maniac.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He blocked off a parking space,&#x201d; Franklin said. &#x201c;He premeditated this thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You think he&#x2019;s guilty, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I work with what I&#x2019;ve got.

Do you have a power of attorney?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s implied. He&#x2019;s in a coma.

It was like a test. Someone new and keen should be at the office on a Sunday.<br><br>Helen Rodin was at the office on a Sunday. She answered the call sitting at her desk. Her desk was secondhand and it sat proudly in a mostly empty two-room suite in the same black glass tower that had NBC as the second-floor tenant. The suite was rented cheap through one of the business subsidies that the city was throwing around like confetti. The idea was to kick-start the rejuvenated downtown area and clean up later with healthy tax revenues.<br><br>Rosemary Barr didn&#x2019;t have to tell Helen Rodin about the case because the whole thing had happened right outside Helen Rodin&#x2019;s new office window. Helen had seen some of it for herself, and she had followed the rest on the news afterward. She had caught all of Ann Yanni&#x2019;s TV appearances. She recognized her from the building&#x2019;s lobby, and the elevator.<br><br>&#x201c;Will you help my brother?&#x201d; Rosemary Barr asked.<br><br>Helen Rodin paused.

Operating in the shadows of well-funded, high-visibility Air Force and Navy projects, the former truck driver and pet store owner set a new world record for manned balloon altitude. Rising more than 23 miles over the South Dakota prairie, Piantanida nearly perished trying to set the world record for the highest free fall parachute jump from that height. On his next attempt, he would not be so lucky.

Teaches counting, days of the week, colors, fruits and so much more. Great teaching tool.</p><p>With its lovely, humorous illustrations and wonderful narrative about a hungry caterpillar growing up to be a beautiful butterfly, Eric Carle&#39;s story touches anyone who still has some growing to do. Along with reassuring repetition--&#34;He was still hungry ...&#34;--the book includes some wonderful interactive moments: what youngster can resist sticking a finger through that hole in the page as his ravenous friend makes his way through various delicacies?One sunny Sunday, the caterpillar was hatched out of a tiny egg. He was very hungry. On Monday, he ate through one apple; on Tuesday, he ate through three plums--and <i>still</i> he was hungry. Strikingly bold, colorful pictures and a simple text in large, clear type tell the story of a hungry little caterpillar's progress through an amazing variety and quantity of foods. Full at last, he made a cocoon around himself and went to sleep, to wake up a few weeks later wonderfully transformed into a butterfly!<p> Brilliantly innovative designer and artist Eric Carle has dramatized the story of one of Nature's commonest yet loveliest marvels, the metamorphosis of the butterfly, in a picture book to delight as well as instruct the very youngest reader or listener. Cleverly die-cut pages show what the caterpillar ate on successive days, graphically introducing sets of up to 10 objects and also the names of the days of the week in rotation, as well as telling the central story of the transformation of the caterpillar. The final, double-page picture of the butterfly is a joyous explosion of color, a vibrant affirmation of the wonder and beauty of Nature.</p></p><h2>The Man Who Was Thursday</h2><p>An unabridged edition, to include: The Unusual Soir�e - The Anarchists&#39; Council - The Tale of a Detective - The Feast of Fear - The Exposure - The Unaccountable Conduct of Professor de Worms - The Man in Spectacles - The Duel - The Criminals Chase the Police - The Earth in Anarchy - The Pursuit of the President - The Six Philosophers - The Accuser</p><p>In an article published the day before his death, G.K. Chesterton called <i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i> "a very melodramatic sort of moonshine." Set in a phantasmagoric London where policemen are poets and anarchists camouflage themselves as, well, anarchists, his 1907 novel offers up one highly colored enigma after another. If that weren't enough, the author also throws in an elephant chase and a hot-air-balloon pursuit in which the pursuers suffer from "the persistent refusal of the balloon to follow the roads, and the still more persistent refusal of the cabmen to follow the balloon." <p> But Chesterton is also concerned with more serious questions of honor and truth (and less serious ones, perhaps, of duels and dualism). Our hero is Gabriel Syme, a policeman who cannot reveal that his fellow poet Lucian Gregory is an anarchist. In Chesterton's agile, antic hands, Syme is the virtual embodiment of paradox: </p><blockquote> He came of a family of cranks, in which all the oldest people had all the newest notions. One of his uncles always walked about without a hat, and another had made an unsuccessful attempt to walk about with a hat and nothing else. His father cultivated art and self-realization; his mother went in for simplicity and hygiene. Hence the child, during his tenderer years, was wholly unacquainted with any drink between the extremes of absinthe and cocoa, of both of which he had a healthy dislike.... Being surrounded with every conceivable kind of revolt from infancy, Gabriel had to revolt into something, so he revolted into the only thing left--sanity. </blockquote> Elected undercover into the Central European Council of anarchists, Syme must avoid discovery <i>and</i> save the world from any bombings in the offing. As Thursday (each anarchist takes the name of a weekday--the only quotidian thing about this fantasia) does his best to undo his new colleagues, the masks multiply. The question then becomes: Do they reveal or conceal? And who, not to mention what, can be believed? As <i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i> proceeds, it becomes a hilarious numbers game with a more serious undertone--what happens if most members of the council actually turn out to be on the side of right? Chesterton's tour de force is a thriller that is best read slowly, so as to savor his highly anarchic take on anarchy. <i>--Kerry Fried</i>G. K. Chesterton&#39;s surreal masterpiece is a psychological thriller that centers on seven anarchists in turn-of-the-century London who call themselves by the names of the days of the week. Chesterton explores the meanings of their disguised identities in what is a fascinating mystery and, ultimately, a spellbinding allegory. As Jonathan Lethem remarks in his Introduction, The real characters are the ideas. Chesterton&#39;s nutty agenda is really quite simple: to expose moral relativism and parlor nihilism for the devils he believes them to be. This wouldn&#39;t be interesting at all, though, if he didn&#39;t also show such passion for giving the devil his due. He animates the forces of chaos and anarchy with every ounce of imaginative verve and rhetorical force in his body.</p><h2>Hall's Ireland; Mr. &amp; Mrs. Hall's Tour of Ireland of 1840</h2><p>Scott, Michael (editor).

In an extraordinarily full life he wrote, campaigned and spoke on a huge range of issues, and was involved in many of the key aspects of Victorian life, by turns cajoling, moving and irritating. He completed fourteen full-length novels and volume after volume of journalism. Barnaby Rudge, Dickens&#39;s fifth novel, is set against the backdrop of the violent Gordon Riots of 1780. The Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist, Nicholas Nickleby, The Old Curiosity Shop, A Christmas Carol, Martin Chuzzlewit, Dombey and Son, David Copperfield, Bleak House, Hard Times, Little Dorrit, A Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations, Our Mutual Friend and The Mystery of Edwin Drood are also published in the Penguin English Library.</p><h2>My Beloved Son</h2><p>Fatherless at five, Joseph Jebeau grows up to defend his country against Hitler&#39;s mad ambitions and to defend himself against his mother&#39;s ruthlessness and secrets from the past</p><p>Ellen Jebeau married a man who did little but dream, and who then died with debt his only legacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever else her marriage had lacked, however, she had her son Joseph.&nbsp;&nbsp;She resolved he should have all in life she had missed and to achieve that end, she would stop at nothing. <br> <br>It was Sir Arthur Jebeau, her late husband's brother, who came to her aid, and soon Ellen and Joseph were living at the old family seat at Screehaugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a convenient arrangement, one which Ellen was not slow to recognise could work to her advantage, for Sir Arthur was a widower and Screehaugh had no mistress... <br> <br>That was in 1926, but the working out of so many increasingly intertwined destinies would continue for twenty more years and only come to final resolution with Joseph Jebeau's escape from the traumatic heritage of his mother's ruthless ambition and his emergence as his own true self. <br> <br>MY BELOVED SON will rank among Catherine Cookson's most compelling and deeply moving novels and her portrayal of Joseph Jebeau is as sensitive and percipient as any this well-loved author has achieved.<b>Catherine Cookson</b> lived in Northumberland, England, the setting of many of her international bestsellers. Born in Tyne Dock, she was the illegitimate daughter of an impoverished woman, Kate, whom she was raised to believe was her older sister. She began to work in the civil service but eventually moved south to Hastings, where she met and married a local grammar school master.<br>Although she was originally acclaimed as a regional writer, in 1968 her novel <i>The Round Tower</i> won the Winifred Holtby Award, her readership quickly spread worldwide, and her many bestselling novels established her as one of the most popular contemporary authors. After receiving an OBE in 1985, Catherine Cookson was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1993. She died shortly before her ninety-second birthday, in June 1998, having completed 104 works.</p><h2>Foundations &amp; Concrete Work (For Pros by Pros)</h2><p>Foundation work is not the glamorous side of home building.

He set up a medical practice and introduced an outlandish surgical method using goat glands to restore the fading virility of local farmers.<br><br>It was all nonsense, of course, but thousands of paying customers quickly turned &#x201c;Dr.&#x201d; Brinkley into America&#x2019;s richest and most famous surgeon. His notoriety captured the attention of the great quackbuster Morris Fishbein, who vowed to put the country&#x2019;s &#x201c;most daring and dangerous&#x201d; charlatan out of business.<br><br>Their cat-and-mouse game lasted throughout the 1920s and &#x2019;30s, but despite Fishbein&#x2019;s efforts Brinkley prospered wildly. When he ran for governor of Kansas, he invented campaigning techniques still used in modern politics. Thumbing his nose at American regulators, he built the world&#x2019;s most powerful radio transmitter just across the Rio Grande to offer sundry cures, and killed or maimed patients by the score, yet his warped genius produced innovations in broadcasting that endure to this day. By introducing country music and blues to the nation, Brinkley also became a seminal force in rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll. In short, he is the most creative criminal this country has ever produced.<br><br>Culminating in a decisive courtroom confrontation that pit Brinkley against his nemesis Fishbein, <i>Charlatan</i> is a marvelous portrait of a boundlessly audacious rogue on the loose in an America that was ripe for the bamboozling.</p><p>POPE BROCK is the author of the critically acclaimed <i>Indiana Gothic</i>, the story of his great-grandfather&#x2019;s murder in 1908. Brock has written for numerous publications, including <i>Rolling Stone, Esquire, GQ</i>, and the <i>London Sunday Times Magazine</i>. He lives in upstate New York with his twin daughters, Molly and Hannah.1<br><br>In the period before the First World War, the Reinhardt brothers, Willis and Wallace, owned a thriving chain of anatomical museums: the London Medical Institute, the Paris Medical Institute, the Heidelberg, the Copenhagen, and so forth. Located in Des Moines, Fort Wayne, East St. Louis, and other towns throughout the Midwest, they were devoted to the documentation and cure of "men's secret diseases." Most had big display windows facing the street, and what the Reinhardts put in those windows was the talk of the industry. Their most celebrated exhibit, in Minneapolis, was entitled "The Dying Custer."<br><br>He lay like Saint Sebastian, bristling with arrows, in a lavish three-dimensional tableau. Redskins, corpses, and plaster vultures added richness to the scene, but what kept passersby bunched at the window, staring in for minutes on end, was the slow, rhythmic heaving of Custer's chest. They gazed till their own breathing fell into sync--it was irresistible--and that gave the Reinhardts' message time to go to work. True, Custer's connection to impotence may have been largely metaphorical, but to a certain fretful portion of the populace it struck home. Power gone, youth destroyed--but not yet, not quite yet. Inside this building there was even hope for Yellow Hair.<br><br>Mixing terror and hope was the Reinhardts' stock-in-trade. Their window in Gary, Indiana--again designed by their visionary house artist, Monsieur Brouillard--featured a diorama of a doctor and nurse trying to save a syphilitic baby with the help of a wheezing resuscitator. But displays alone, no matter how artful, didn't make the Reinhardt twins tops in their field. From their headquarters at the Vienna Medical Institute in Chicago, where they rode herd on some three dozen franchises, they enforced levels of standardization and quality control remarkably ahead of their time. Starting with their training of salesmen: nobody worked for the Reinhardts without first graduating from the "instantaneous medical college" at the home office. This was followed by more training at the Gary branch, where each recruit was given a white coat, asked to grow a Vandyke, and made to practice his patter as if it were Gilbert and Sullivan. Only then were real customers released upon them. Serving as exhibition guides, the floor men were expected to nail twenty percent of all prospects--eight out of an average forty walk-ins a day--or look for another job. The manager of each institute sent headquarters a daily financial report in triplicate.<br><br>Admission was free at all these places. The abba-dabba juice was not. Bottles of it were on sale at the exit, a fabled elixir guaranteed to soothe, stimulate, inflate, reinstate, backdate, laminate, and in general make "the withered bough quicken and grow green again," while at the same time curing and/or preventing the clap; it adapted to the needs of the customer. What was in it? What was in any of them? What was in Dr. Raphael's Cordial Invigorant, America's first big virility tonic in the 1850s, whose royal Arabian formula was made vastly more potent by the "magical influence of modern Astrologers"? What was the recipe for Baume de Vie, Elixir Renovans, the Syrop Vitae of Anthony Bellou, the Glorious Spagyric of Jone Case, or any of the others in lands and ages stretching back to the dawn of time? For the record, the Reinhardts' tonic contained three ingredients--alcohol, sugar, and a dash of "Aqua Missourianas quantitat sufficiat ad cong II"--but this is pedantry.<br><br>Big as they were, the Reinhardts still had plenty of competition. Independents with similar rackets were out there grubbing in the twilight, men like Dr. Burke of Knoxville, Tennessee, who in 1907 was running his own small shop with the help of an assistant, Dr. John Brinkley.<br><br>Young Brinkley was a likely lad of twenty-two. To call him a doctor was, in the strictest sense, inaccurate, but if the white coat reassured people, the healing had begun. In truth he was the floor man and he worked on commission. Brinkley would study a prospect as he came through the door, then materialize--not too soon--at his elbow. The young physician chatted, he chuckled, he took a grave interest; he showed the man around. Soon the two were passing along the main line of exhibits: a stage-by-stage depiction of the male member in syphilitic decline. It spoke for itself. With each new cabinet the organ grew more deformed and the colors changed. Perhaps leprosy was mentioned by way of comparison.<br><br>In the last room the customer met The Boy.<br><br>It was known by that name throughout the trade, and every "free educational anatomical institute" worth its salt had one. The scene was replayed countless times: while the salesman hung back, or bent to tie his shoe, the customer approached a rectangular pillar walled in glass. It was pitch-dark inside. The mark moved toward it cautiously, perhaps glancing back at his guide for the go-ahead, peered in close trying to see what was in there--and then the lights blazed on full, and the grinning wax face of an idiot sprang into view. Horrifying as it was, the warning above it was even worse:<br><br>LOST MANHOOD<br><br>The customer knew then that he wasn't just looking at a vile mask with dripping yellow eyes. He was looking at the future. He was looking at himself.<br><br>After this bit of venereal kabuki--"the convincer," in quack talk--the rest was usually easy. As Dr. Burke sat at a desk, possibly lost in a medical tome, Dr. Brinkley brought the poor sinner forward and introduced him. Burke gave him an "instant consultation" ("Are you ever thirsty?" "Do you sometimes suffer from fatigue?"--warning signs all) and produced a bottle of peerless tonic, which the man was assured would save his organ and probably his life. The price was almost as big a shock as The Boy, between ten and twenty dollars, but who in his right mind would economize at a time like this? Moments later the customer was standing in the alley with the hooey in his hand and the door shut firmly behind him.<br><br>How much satisfaction Brinkley felt at such moments is unknown. The greatest quacks never gloat for long; when deception is the drug, there's no building up a supply. Besides, he had so much ambition that working in two tatty rooms with a substandard Boy could have been depressing at times.<br><br>On the other hand, he might have taken pride in having gotten so far so young. Brinkley came from the tiny town of Beta, North Carolina, tucked in the Great Smokies not far from the Tennessee line. Like his neighbors, he grew up on a hilly little farm that produced mostly rocks. He ate mush and greens and lashed gunnysacks to his feet for winter boots. The thick forests and hard climbs, the rainy days when bowls of fog gathered in the valleys, the strangers scarce as hen's teeth: all this conspired to make the outside world seem little more than a rumor, so it was natural that most people, if they started out there, stayed put.<br><br>Not Brinkley. "Kind of a recklesslike boy," one neighbor called him. "Lively as a cricket," another said. And all the while he burned with a bitter fire, and he dreamed. ("I thought of John Brinkley freeing the slaves," he said later, "John Brinkley illuminating the world, John Brinkley facing an assassin's bullet for the sake of his people, John Brinkley healing the sick.") But with the slaves freed, the world lit, and nobody caring enough about him to kill him, he chose number four--sort of. First he married Sally Wike, a spitfire from a neighboring farm, as eager as he was to escape the prison of the mountains. Then "he got up a little play," as Mrs. Ann Bennett, who boarded them briefly, recalled it, "and he and his wife and some more people went on the road from town to town, you know, giving little plays."<br><br>He sang and he danced and he healed. Barely twenty, Brinkley got his precocious start touring as a type of medicine man known as a Quaker doctor. Though, in the general run of Quakers, specialty numbers were almost unknown, some itinerant quacks in those days liked to impersonate them, trading on their legendary rectitude. Some folks saw through the act, but it hardly mattered. Fooling some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time was plenty.<br><br>They usually performed at night. A platform was unfolded and torches placed at each corner as the audience gathered, drawn by handbills and word of mouth. While there is no specific record of a Brinkley performance, there was a set pattern to most Quaker-doctor shows. First a fiddler or a dancer got the crowd warmed up. A short morality play followed, in which a noble head of house or ringleted female died pathetically for lack of a miracle tonic, identified by name. Finally the physician himself (Brinkley) shot onstage in a dinner-plate hat, cutaway coat, and pious pants that buttoned up the sides, theeing and thouing, singing and selling, waving a bottle of Ayer's Cathartic Pills. Or maybe Burdock Blood Bitters or Aunt Fanny's Worm Candy. One thing was for sure, whatever it was cured whatever you had.<br><br>With his unerring nose for where the money was, Brinkley had already become an American archetype: the quack on the boards. For in our nation with its special genius for swindle--where swampland, beefsteak mines, and tickets to nonexistent attractions practically sell themselves--medical fraud had always been the king of cons. At the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, a man dressed as a cowboy appeared onstage and strangled rattlesnakes by the dozen. He called what came out of them snake oil. People bought it.<br><br>Of course quacks have flourished in all ages and cultures, for nothing shows reason the door like cures for things. Unlike most scams, which target greed, quackery fires deeper into Jungian universals: our fear of death, our craving for miracles. When we see night approaching, nearly all of us are rubes.<br><br>Still, there has probably never been a more quack-prone and quac...</p><h2>Odd Bits</h2><p>We&#39;re all familiar with prime cuts of meat - the beef tenderloin, rack of lamb, and pork chops.

Byrd is known for being the first to fly a plane over the North and South Poles, while Igloo is famous for being the only dog to explore both the North and South Poles. The adventures of Byrd and Igloo opened the door for science and research in the Antarctic. Featuring direct quotes from letters, diaries and interviews, newspaper clippings, expedition records, maps, charts, as well as never-before-seen photos, it will give the complete story of the explorers' journey. Though rooted in history with evidence from many museums and research centers, Byrd &amp; Igloo will be exciting in tone, making it accessible and interesting for young readers.</p><p>Samantha Seiple has worked as a competitive intelligence specialist for a Fortune 100 company, professionally as a librarian, and is an experienced researcher, and former production editor and copy editor, in addition to being an author. Her education includes a master's degree in library and information science and a bachelor's degree with a double major in English and journalism. She currently resides in San Diego, where she is a freelance writer.<br><br>Gr 3-6-Readers learn about Richard E. Byrd's arctic adventures from the point of view of the small dog that accompanied him every step of the way. While some background information is provided about the explorer and aviator's earlier years, Seiple's work primarily focuses on the years between 1926 and 1931 when Byrd's dog, Igloo, was with him and during which time he flew over both the North and South poles. Told in narrative style in brief chapters, their adventures read more like a novel than a history book as a great deal of anthropomorphizing of Igloo's thoughts and feelings are included. However, the use of a dog is an excellent gateway into polar adventure for elementary students and makes it a more compelling read. Much of the book draws from primary sources and includes a number of photographs, adding interest and historical credibility, but it is better suited for general-interest reading than report writing. Overall this is a solid and engaging look at Byrd's explorations that will appeal to children interested in history and adventure.-Elizabeth Nicolai, Anchorage Public Library, AK&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Because many of us have set aside hope and the inspired imagination that drives it, Dekker says we have been lulled into a slumber of boredom, even despondency. Our faith wanes, the joy at having been liberated fades, and we feel powerless. <em>The Slumber of Christianity</em> explores what robs us of happiness and how we can rediscover it and live lives that rekindle hope. The pursuit of pleasure is a gift to all humans-a function of the Creator himself, who is bent upon our happiness.</p> <p>It's time for Christians to reclaim our inheritance of pleasure. <em>The Slumber of Christianity</em> will inflame hearts toward full-fledged, mind-expanding encounters with hope, through the imagination. </p></p><p><b>Ted Dekker</b> is known for novels that combine adrenaline-laced stories with unexpected plot twists, unforgettable characters, and incredible confrontations between good and evil. Ted lives in Austin with his wife LeeAnn and their four children.In his debut nonfiction work following a plethora of successful novels (White; Three), Dekker exhorts Christians to wake up and find genuine happiness in cultivating a deep desire for heaven. Although he argues that Christians should enjoy the pleasures of earth as a "foretaste" of heaven, he cautions that these pleasures should not be mistaken for the real thing. Relying heavily on C.S. Lewis and the Apostle Paul, he makes a case for hope as the "engine of life." Satan, he says, has redirected our obsession away from God and heaven by filling our minds with earthly things. With the relentless zeal of an evangelist, Dekker illustrates many of his points with excerpts from his novels and from scripture, but his thought flow is sometimes problematic. He offers three practical ideas for setting one's mind on heaven-meditations, readings and corporate exercises-but fails to satisfactorily flesh them out. Although Dekker clearly has a sincere passion for his topic, Mark Buchanan's "Things Unseen" and Arthur Roberts's "Exploring Heaven" are better choices to excite desire for the afterlife. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Looking for mushrooms in the forest, a young girl saves a wren from a fowlers net and to show its gratitude, the bird grants her any wish. Luba realizes that she is content and when she declines the wish, the wren tells her, If ever you want for anything, come to the forest and call me. When the child tells her parents about the incident, they send her back to the wren five times, each time asking for a grander home and more riches until, after they have become Emperor and Empress of all the world, they ask to be as Gods. When the wish is granted, they are returned to their former peasant life, but are truly contented and realize that Luba is their greatest treasure. Polaccos signature illustrations are lush and vibrant. The regal colors of royal blue and crimson play against deep green, dappled brown, and ocher of the natural world. Rosy-cheeked Luba appears humble and honest in her babushka and Ukrainian peasant apparel throughout, while her parents, as they increasingly receive greater material wealth, don the clothing of royalty. Scrolled, intricate frames set the text apart from the lively folk-artlike illustrations. Like Rosemary Wellss The Fisherman and His Wife (Dial, 1998), this picture book examines true happiness and the snares of yearning for material things.Shawn Brommer, Southern Tier Library System, Painted Post, NY <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Authentic Christianity</h2><p><p> Ray Stedman's passion encourages you to be an authentic Christian&#x2015;to move you beyond religion, doctrines, rules, and rituals&#x2015;and into the life-changing experience of being genuinely and intimately connected with Christ.</p> <p> <i>Authentic Christianity</i>&nbsp;takes a look at 2 Corinthians to show you how to live a life of faith with integrity and regain the purpose, simplicity, and inspiration of genuine faith&#x2015;the kind of life that compels others to seek its Source.</p></p><p><p>Authentic Christianity proclaims the most liberating secret in all of Scripture: "Christ in you, the hope of glory."

People and organizations often don t believe they have the time to perform the in-depth analyses required to solve problems. Instead, they take remedial actions to make the problem less visible and implement a patchwork of ad hoc solutions they hope will prevent recurrence. Then when the problem returns, they get frustrated and the cycle repeats. This book provides detailed steps for how to solve problems, focusing more heavily on the analytical process involved in finding the actual causes of problems. It does so using a large number of figures, diagrams, and tools useful for helping make our thinking visible. The primary focus is on solving repetitive problems, rather than performing investigations for major incidents/accidents. Most of the terminology used is everyday language and can therefore also be used for applications in their personal lives. Many of the examples will involve situations with which the reader will likely be familiar. The focus of the book not on statistics but instead on the logic of finding causes. It has sometimes been described in training workshops as Six Sigma lite ...problem solving without the all the heavy statistics.</p><p></p><h2>Laurel Canyon: The Inside Story of Rock-and-Roll&#39;s Legendary Neighborhood</h2><p>In the late sixties and early seventies, an impromptu collection of musicians colonized a eucalyptus-scented canyon deep in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles and melded folk, rock, and savvy American pop into a sound that conquered the world as thoroughly as the songs of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones had before them. Thirty years later, the music made in Laurel Canyon continues to pour from radios, iPods, and concert stages around the world. During the canyon's golden era, the musicians who lived and worked there scored dozens of landmark hits, from "California Dreamin'" to "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes" to "It's Too Late," selling tens of millions of records and resetting the thermostat of pop culture.<br><br>In <i>Laurel Canyon</i>, veteran journalist Michael Walker tells the inside story of this unprecedented gathering of some of the baby boom's leading musical lights--including Joni Mitchell; Jim Morrison; Crosby, Stills, and Nash; John Mayall; the Mamas and the Papas; Carole King; the Eagles; and Frank Zappa, to name just a few--who turned Los Angeles into the music capital of the world and forever changed the way popular music is recorded, marketed, and consumed<i>.</i><br></p><p>Michael Walker has written extensively about popular culture for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and other publications.

Published in May 2006 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, LLC. All rights reserved.<br>&nbsp;<br>PREFACE<br>&nbsp;<br>In 1968 a British pop star and the refugees from two seminal Los Angeles bands gathered in a cottage on Lookout Mountain Avenue in Laurel Canyon, the slightly seedy, camp-like neighborhood of serpentine one-lane roads, precipitous hills, fragrant eucalyptus trees, and softly crumbling bungalows set down improbably in the middle of Los Angeles, and sang together for the first time. The occupant of the cottage, which had moldering shake shingles and draft-prone casement windows, was a Canadian painter, poet, and folksinger named Joni Mitchell. The British pop star, sporting a wisp of a goatee and a thick Manchester brogue, was Graham Nash, founding member of the Hollies. The refugees were Stephen Stills, late of the Buffalo Springfield, writer and singer of "For What It's Worth," who had three years before auditioned for the Monkees and, having failed, recommended his friend, a folkie named Peter Torkelson; and David Crosby, late of the Byrds and "Mr. Tambourine Man," possessed of a Buffalo Bill mustache, an immaculate harmony voice, and piercing eyes that Mitchell, with typical literary flourish, likened to star sapphires. (Crosby produced Mitchell's debut album, <i>Song to a Seagull</i>.) So it was that Nash, Stills, and Crosby sat in Mitchell's living room on Lookout Mountain, in the heart of Laurel Canyon, in the epicenter of L.A.'s nascent rock music industry, and for the first time, began to sing together.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is a measure of Laurel Canyon's mythmaking powers that this particular watershed may have actually occurred not at Mitchell's cottage--though that's the way Nash and plenty of others remember it--but a mile away in the living room of Cass Elliot of the Mamas and the Papas, who along with Mitchell briefly co-reigned as unofficial queen of the canyon, one an inscrutable poet-genius, the other a bosomy, meddling mother figure. What is certain is that within the year, Nash, Stills, and Crosby apotheosized into Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, the third group with Laurel Canyon roots within as many years--after the Byrds and Buffalo Springfield--to score a knockout with their first record. Nash moved into Mitchell's cottage on Lookout, there to write his ode to countercultural domestic bliss, "Our House." Mitchell, in turn, wrote and recorded "Ladies of the Canyon," her paean to the strange bohemian netherland where she and Nash nurtured their affair and where it would soon become evident that some of the twentieth century's most talented and enterprising young men and women had gathered at just the right moment.<br>&nbsp;<br>Laurel Canyon had been filling up with musicians from Los Angeles, New York, and London since the mid-1960s: Mitchell was a transplant from New York via Saskatoon; Carole King had recently decamped to a place on Appian Way; so had Nico, the Teutonic waif from Andy Warhol's Factory. Up the street from Mitchell's place were John Phillips, Michelle Phillips, and Denny Doherty of the Mamas and the Papas, who, until they moved west and recorded "California Dreamin'" and "Monday, Monday," had busked around as semi-obscure folksingers. British bands touring the States made it a point to stop by Laurel Canyon for a party or two--Beatles, Stones, Animals, Yardbirds, and the rest. Some never left--the British blues legend John Mayall bought a house just over the ridge from Mitchell's place. It was Brigadoon meets the Brill Building, and the repercussions thirty-odd years later continue to pour from radios, iPods, and concert stages around the world.</p><h2>The Prophet</h2><p>Written in parables reminiscent of the Bible, Gibran&#39;s famous inspirational book, first published in 1923, emphasizes caring human relationships. This facsimile of the original edition features a foil-stamped, leather-like cover, colored endpapers, and a ribbon marker.</p><p>In a distant, timeless place, a mysterious prophet walks the sands. At the moment of his departure, he wishes to offer the people gifts but possesses nothing. The people gather round, each asks a question of the heart, and the man's wisdom is his gift. It is Gibran's gift to us, as well, for Gibran's prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world's great religions. On the most basic topics--marriage, children, friendship, work, pleasure--his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description "divinely inspired." Free of dogma, free of power structures and metaphysics, consider these poetic, moving aphorisms a 20th-century supplement to all sacred traditions--as millions of other readers already have. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>1 cassette / 90 minutes<br><b>Unabridged</b><p><b>The Prophet</b> is Kahlil Gibran's masterpiece, his most celebrated statement about the truths of the human experience.</p><p>Gibran considered <i>The Prophet</i> to be his greatest achievement.

Colors and shapes with willowy details expertly blur or bring bits of the images into focus to create a magical sense of place, time, and beauty. ...

Instead, I roused our florist, Mr. Sitwell, from his bed to make a boutonni�re. My first consulate gala was no time to stand on ceremony. <br> <br>I joined the riptide of the great unwashed moving up Fifth Avenue. Men in gray-felted fedoras pushed by me, the morning papers in their attach�s bearing the last benign headlines of the decade. There was no storm gathering in the east that day, no portent of things to come. The only ominous sign from the direction of Europe was the scent of slack water wafting off the East River. <br> <br>As I neared our building at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Forty-ninth Street, I felt Roger watching from the window above. He&#x2019;d fired people for a lot less than being twenty minutes late, but the one time of year the New York elite opened their wallets and pretended they cared about France was no time for skimpy boutonni�res. <br> <br>I turned at the corner, the morning sun alive in the gold-leaf letters chiseled in the cornerstone: la maison fran�aise. The French Building, home to the French Consulate, stood side by side with the British Empire Building, facing Fifth Avenue, part of Rockefeller Center, Junior Rockefeller&#x2019;s new complex of granite and limestone. Many foreign consulates kept offices there then, resulting in a great stew of international diplomacy. <br> <br>&#x201c;All the way to the back and face the front,&#x201d; said Cuddy, our elevator operator. <br> <br>Mr. Rockefeller handpicked the elevator boys, screening for manners and good looks. Cuddy was heavy on the looks, though his hair was already salt-and-peppered, his body in a hurry to age. <br> <br>Cuddy fixed his gaze on the illuminated numbers above the doors. &#x201c;You got a crowd up there today, Miss Ferriday. Pia said there&#x2019;s two new boats in.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Delightful,&#x201d; I said. <br> <br>Cuddy brushed something off the sleeve of his navy-blue uniform jacket. &#x201c;Another late one tonight?&#x201d; <br> <br>For the fastest elevators in the world, ours still took forever. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be gone by five. Gala tonight.&#x201d; <br> <br>I loved my job. Grandmother Woolsey had started the work tradition in our family, nursing soldiers on the battlefield at Gettysburg. But my volunteer post as head of family assistance for the French Consulate wasn&#x2019;t work really. Loving all things French was simply genetic for me. My father may have been half-Irish, but his heart belonged to France. Plus, Mother had inherited an apartment in Paris, where we spent every August, so I felt at home there. <br> <br>The elevator stopped. Even through the closed doors, we could hear a terrific din of raised voices. A shiver ran through me. <br> <br>&#x201c;Third floor,&#x201d; Cuddy called out. &#x201c;French Consulate. Watch your&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> <br>Once the doors parted, the noise overpowered all polite speech. The hallway outside our reception area was packed so tightly with people one could scarcely step through. Both the Normandie and the Ile de France, two of France&#x2019;s premier ocean liners, had landed that morning in New York Harbor, packed with wealthy passengers fleeing the uncertainty in France. Once the all-clear horn signaled and they were free to disembark, the ships&#x2019; elite streamed to the consulate to iron out visa problems and other sticky issues. <br> <br>I squeezed into the smoky reception area, past ladies in Paris&#x2019;s newest day dresses who stood gossiping in a lovely cloud of Arp�ge, the sea spray still in their hair. The people in this group were accustomed to being shadowed by a butler with a crystal ashtray and a champagne flute. Bellboys in scarlet jackets from the Normandie went toe-to-toe with their black-jacketed counterparts from the Ile de France. I wedged one shoulder through the crowd, toward our secretary&#x2019;s desk at the back of the room, and my chiffon scarf snagged on the clasp of one ravishing creature&#x2019;s pearls. As I worked to extract it, the intercom buzzed unanswered. <br> <br>Roger. <br> <br>I pressed on through, felt a pat on my behind, and turned to see a midshipman flash a plaquey smile. <br> <br>&#x201c;Gardons nos mains pour nous-m�mes,&#x201d; I said. Let&#x2019;s keep our hands to ourselves. <br> <br>The boy raised his arm above the crowd and dangled his Normandie stateroom key. At least he wasn&#x2019;t the over-sixty type I usually attracted. <br> <br>I made it to our secretary&#x2019;s desk, where she sat, head down, typing. <br> <br>&#x201c;Bonjour, Pia.&#x201d; <br> <br>Roger&#x2019;s cousin, a sloe-eyed boy of eighteen, was sitting on Pia&#x2019;s desk, legs crossed. He held his cigarette in the air as he picked through a box of chocolates, Pia&#x2019;s favorite breakfast. My inbox on her desk was already stacked with case folders. <br> <br>&#x201c;Vraiment? What is so good about it?&#x201d; she said, not lifting her head. <br> <br>Pia was much more than a secretary. We all wore many hats, and hers included signing in new clients and establishing a folder for each, typing up Roger&#x2019;s considerable correspondence, and deciphering the massive flood of daily Morse-code pulses that was the lifeblood of our office. <br> <br>&#x201c;Why is it so hot in here?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The phone is ringing, Pia.&#x201d; <br> <br>She plucked a chocolate from the box. &#x201c;It keeps doing that.&#x201d; <br> <br>Pia attracted beaux as if she emitted a frequency only males could detect. She was attractive in a feral way, but I suspected her popularity was due in part to her tight sweaters. <br> <br>&#x201c;Can you take some of my cases today, Pia?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Roger says I can&#x2019;t leave this chair.&#x201d; She broke the shell of the chocolate&#x2019;s underside with her manicured thumb, stalking the strawberry cr�mes. &#x201c;He also wants to see you right away, but I think the woman on the sofa slept in the hallway last night.&#x201d; Pia flapped one half of a one-hundred-dollar bill at me. &#x201c;And the fatty with the dogs says he&#x2019;ll give you the other half if you take him first.&#x201d; She nodded toward the well-fed older couple near my office door, each holding a brace of gray-muzzled dachshunds. <br> <br>Like Pia&#x2019;s, my job description was wide-ranging. It included attending to the needs of French citizens here in New York&#x2014;often families fallen on hard times&#x2014;and overseeing my French Families Fund, a charity effort through which I sent comfort boxes to French orphans overseas. I&#x2019;d just retired from an almost two-decade-long stint on Broadway, and this felt easy by comparison. It certainly involved less unpacking of trunks. <br> <br>My boss, Roger Fortier, appeared in his office doorway. <br> <br>&#x201c;Caroline, I need you now. Bonnet&#x2019;s canceled.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be serious, Roger.&#x201d; The news came like a punch. I&#x2019;d secured the French foreign minister as our gala keynote speaker months before. <br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not easy being the French foreign minister right now,&#x201d; he called over his shoulder as he went back inside. <br> <br>I stepped into my office and flipped through the Wheeldex on my desk. Was Mother&#x2019;s Buddhist-monk friend Ajahn Chah free that night? <br> <br>&#x201c;Caroline&#x2014;&#x201d; Roger called. I grabbed my Wheeldex and hurried to his office, avoiding the couple with the dachshunds, who were trying their best to look tragic. <br> <br>&#x201c;Why were you late this morning?&#x201d; Roger asked. &#x201c;Pia&#x2019;s been here for two hours already.&#x201d; <br> <br>As consul general, Roger Fortier ruled from the corner suite with its commanding view of Rockefeller Plaza and the Promenade Cafe. Normally the famous skating rink occupied that sunken spot, but the rink was closed for the summer, the space now filled with caf� tables and tuxedoed waiters rushing about with aprons to their ankles. Beyond, Paul Manship&#x2019;s massive golden Prometheus fell to earth, holding his stolen fire aloft. Behind it, the RCA Building shot up seventy floors into the sapphire sky. Roger had a lot in common with the imposing male figure of Wisdom chiseled above the building&#x2019;s entrance. The furrowed brow. The beard. The angry eyes. <br> <br>&#x201c;I stopped for Bonnet&#x2019;s boutonni�re&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s worth keeping half of France waiting.&#x201d; Roger bit into a doughnut, and powdered sugar cascaded down his beard. Despite what might kindly be called a husky figure, he was never at a loss for female companions. <br> <br>His desk was heaped with folders, security documents, and dossiers on missing French citizens. According to the French Consulate Handbook, his job was &#x201c;to assist French nationals in New York, in the event of theft, serious illness, or arrest and with issues related to birth certificates, adoption, and lost or stolen documents; to plan visits of French officials and fellow diplomats; and to assist with political difficulties and natural disasters.&#x201d; The troubles in Europe provided plenty of work for us in all those categories, if you counted Hitler as a natural disaster. <br> <br>&#x201c;I have cases to get back to, Roger&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> <br>He sent a manila folder skidding across the polished conference table. &#x201c;Not only do we have no speaker; I was up half the night rewriting Bonnet&#x2019;s speech. Had to sidestep Roosevelt letting France buy American planes.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;France should be able to buy all the planes they want.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re raising money here, Caroline. It&#x2019;s not the time to annoy the isolationists. Especially the rich ones.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t support France anyway.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t need any more bad press. Is the U.S. too cozy with France? Will that push Germany and Russia closer? I can barely finish a third course without being interrupted by a reporter. And we can&#x2019;t mention the Rockefellers . . . Don&#x2019;t want another call from Junior. Guess that&#x2019;ll happen anyway now that Bonnet canceled.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a disaster, Roger.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;May need to scrap the whole thing.&#x201d; Roger raked his long fingers through his hair, digging fresh trenches through the Brylcreem. <br> <br>&#x201c;Refund forty thousand dollars? What about the French Families Fund? I&#x2019;m already operating on fumes. Plus, we&#x2019;ve paid for ten pounds of Waldorf salad&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;They call that salad?&#x201d; Roger flipped through his contact cards, half of them illegible and littered with cross-outs. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s pathetique . . . just chopped apples and celery. And those soggy walnuts . . .&#x201d; <br> <br>I scoured my Wheeldex in search of celebrity candidates. Mother and I knew Julia Marlowe, the famous actress, but she was touring Europe. &#x201c;How about Peter Patout? Mother&#x2019;s people have used him.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;The architect?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Of the whole World&#x2019;s Fair. They have that seven-foot robot.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Boring,&#x201d; he said, slapping his silver letter opener against his palm. <br> <br>I flipped to the L&#x2019;s. &#x201c;How about Captain Lehude?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Of the Normandie? Are you serious? He&#x2019;s paid to be dull.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t just discount every suggestion out of hand, Roger. How about Paul Rodierre? Betty says everyone&#x2019;s talking about him.&#x201d; <br> <br>Roger pursed his lips, always a good sign. &#x201c;The actor? I saw his new play in previews. He&#x2019;s good. Tall and attractive, if you go for that look. Fast metabolism, of course.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;At least we know he can memorize a script.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a bit of a loose cannon. And married too, so don&#x2019;t get any ideas.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m through with men, Roger,&#x201d; I said. At thirty-seven, I&#x2019;d resigned myself to singledom. <br> <br>&#x201c;Not sure Rodierre&#x2019;ll do it. See who you can get, but make sure they stick to the script. No Roosevelt&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;No Rockefellers,&#x201d; I finished. <br> <br>Between cases, I called around to various last-minute possibilities, ending up with one option, Paul Rodierre. He was in New York appearing in a new American musical revue at the Broadhurst Theatre, The Streets of Paris, Carmen Miranda&#x2019;s cyclonic Broadway debut. <br> <br>I phoned the William Morris Agency and was told they&#x2019;d check and call me back. Ten minutes later, M. Rodierre&#x2019;s agent told me the theater was dark that night and that, though his client did not own evening clothes, he was deeply honored by our request to host the gala that evening. He&#x2019;d meet me at the Waldorf to discuss details. Our apartment on East Fiftieth Street was a stone&#x2019;s throw from the Waldorf, so I rushed there to change into Mother&#x2019;s black Chanel dress. <br> <br>I found M. Rodierre seated at a caf� table in the Waldorf&#x2019;s Peacock Alley bar adjacent to the lobby as the two-ton bronze clock sounded its lovely Westminster Cathedral chime on the half hour. Gala guests in their finest filtered in, headed for the Grand Ballroom upstairs. <br> <br>&#x201c;M. Rodierre?&#x201d; I said. <br> <br>Roger was right about the attractive part. The first thing a person notices about Paul Rodierre, after the initial jolt of his physical beauty, is the remarkable smile. <br> <br>&#x201c;How can I thank you for doing this so last minute, Monsieur?&#x201d; <br> <br>He unfolded himself from his chair, presenting a build better suited to rowing crew on the Charles than playing Broadway. He attempted to kiss my cheek, but I extended my hand to him, and he shook it. It was nice to meet a man my height. <br> <br>&#x201c;My pleasure,&#x201d; he said. <br> <br>His attire was the issue: green trousers, an aubergine velvet sports jacket, brown suede shoes, and worst of all, a black shirt. Only priests and fascists wore black shirts. And gangsters, of course. <br> <br>&#x201c;Do you want to change?&#x201d; I resisted the urge to tidy his hair, which was long enough to pull back with a rubber band. &#x201c;Shave perhaps?&#x201d; According to his agent, M. Rodierre was a guest at the hotel, so his razor sat just a few stories overhead. <br> <br>&#x201c;This is what I wear,&#x201d; he said with a shrug. Typical actor. Why hadn&#x2019;t I known better? The parade of guests en route to the ballroom was growing, the women stunning in their finery, every man in tails and patent leather oxfords or calf opera pumps. <br> <br>&#x201c;This is my first gala,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The consulate&#x2019;s one night to raise money. It&#x2019;s white tie.&#x201d; Would he fit into Father&#x2019;s old tux? The inseam would be right, but it would be much too tight in the shoulders. <br> <br>&#x201c;Are you always this, well, energized, Miss Ferriday?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Well, here in New York, individuality is not always appreciated.&#x201d; I handed him the stapled sheets. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re eager to see the script.&#x201d; <br> <br>He handed it back. &#x201c;No, merci.&#x201d; <br> <br>I pushed it back into his hands. &#x201c;But the consul general himself wrote it.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Tell me again why I&#x2019;m doing this?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s to benefit displaced French citizens all year and my French Families Fund. We help orphans back in France whose parents have been lost for any number of reasons. With all the uncertainty abroad, we&#x2019;re one reliable source of clothes and food. Plus, the Rockefellers will be there tonight.&#x201d; <br> <br>He paged through the speech. &#x201c;They could write a check and avoid this whole thing.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re among our kindest donors, but please don&#x2019;t refer to them. Or President Roosevelt. Or the planes the U.S. sold France. Some of our guests tonight love France, of course, but would rather stay out of a war for now. Roger wants to avoid controversy.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Dancing around things never feels authentic. The audience feels that.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Can you just stick to the script...</p><h2>Sheepdogs: Meet Our Nations Warriors</h2><p>Originally written for children of law enforcement and military officers, SHEEPDOGS: Meet Our Nation&#39;s Warriors teaches all kids to be strong while remaining virtuous in a dangerous world</p><p></p><h2>99 Blessings: An Invitation to Life</h2><p><i>Source of all blessings, you bless us with dreams-dreams while we sleep and dreams in our most wakeful moments. May I be responsive to both forms of dreams and pass these blessings on by living a life that is faithful to their guidance.</i><br><br> &nbsp;<br><br> From beloved author Brother David Steindl-Rast comes this beautiful collection of original blessings meant to guide readers through each day with wisdom and spirit.<br><br> &nbsp;<br><br> This gift book of ninety-nine personal and original blessings from Brother David Steindl-Rast, known for his pioneering work in interfaith dialogue, marks the first time the member of the Benedictine Order of Catholic monks has crafted a series of prayers for the general reader-from Catholics to Protestants, Jews and Muslims, agnostics and uncertain. Blessings are life-giving only as long as we pass them on, so this book is meant to be shared with friends, family, coworkers, strangers, and anyone in need of a few words of inspiration and guidance.</p><p>BROTHER DAVID STEINDL-RAST (b. 1926) is one of the most well-known spiritual teachers in the world. Born in Austria, he came to the United States after receiving his PhD in Psychology from the University of Vienna. As a member of the Benedictine Order of Catholic monks, he is known for pioneering work in interfaith dialogue (especially between Christianity and Buddhism), his promotion of the spiritual practice of gratefulness, and for his efforts to revitalize contemplative prayer life in the Catholic Church. He lectures frequently, both in the United States and abroad.Preface<br><br>An Invitation to Bless<br><br> &nbsp;Listening closely, we can hear how similar they sound, the words <i>blessing</i> and <i>blood.</i> Blessing, rightly understood, is the invis�ible bloodstream pulsating through the universe-alive and life-giving. "Just to live is holy," says the great Jewish sage Abraham Joshua Heschel. "Just to be is a blessing." <br><br>"Bless what there is, for being." Whatever it be, bless it be�cause it exists; you need no other reason. With those words the poet W. H. Auden summarizes "the singular command" with which the universe confronts us humans. Each page of this book invites you in a different way to rise to this challenge and "bless what there is for being." <br><br> For three months or so, I wrote these blessings down-one each day-blessing whatever happened to come to my mind, from insects to the Internet, from friendship to fresh linen. I resisted the temptation to "improve" them later; they stand here as they flowed from my pen. You might open the book at random and let yourself be surprised, or you might read these blessings-maybe one a day-in the order in which they were written. You might want to check the index of keywords and pick the blessing you need at the moment. I wish for you that you become aware of how greatly you yourself are blessed <i>and</i> eager to pass your blessings on. Passing them on is what counts. Blessings are life-giving only as long as we pass them on. The waters of the river Jordan can teach us much about blessing: Fresh and refreshing, they leap down from the Lebanon Mountains, fill the Sea of Galilee to the brim, and make its shores an image of Paradise. Gardens, vineyards, and orchards are heavy with fruit and produce, and the lake itself teems with fish. Then these wa�ters flow on, the Jordan continues, ending in the Dead Sea. What a difference here: The shores are barren desert, and no fish can survive in the briny water. But isn't it the same water? Yes, is the answer, indeed, it is the same water of blessing. But where bless�ing flows in and passes on, everything comes alive; where it flows only in and stops, it stagnates. <br><br>This accounts for the pattern of each blessing in this little book, first expressing delight in a blessing received, following with a resolution to pass it on. And this pattern is repeated over and over. <br><br>Repetition is the way time mirrors the eternal Now. Rep�etition with slight differences never fails to thrill our sense of beauty-a theme with variations in music, even a row of weath�ered fence posts along a paddock. Maybe our memory of the first sound that ever struck our budding ears in infancy, our mother's heartbeat when we were still daydreaming in her womb, gave us this love for repetition. And maybe the first stirring, then, of what would later mature into awe accounts for the important role that repetition plays in incantations and blessings. Allow yourself to feel its magic power. Ninety-nine times you will find it repeated here; the hundredth time I give you only the pattern for you to fill in some blessing that you welcome and want to pass on. Once you discover the joy this pattern can trigger, you will want to repeat it not just a hundred but innumerable times. <br><br> May this patchwork quilt of blessings help to sharpen your taste for the gift of life in its innumerable facets. May you grow ever more blessed, ever more able to bless. <br><br>1<br>S O U R C E O F A L L B L E S S I N G S ,<br>you bless us with w i n d .<br>Gentle or fierce, warm and humid<br>or icy or hot and dry, may it<br>caress my skin and make it tingle,<br>refresh my spirit and make it wide<br>awake so that I might to pass<br>on lightheartedness to everyone<br>I meet.<br><br>2<br>S O U R C E O F A L L B L E S S I N G S ,<br>you bless us with b r e a t h .<br>In and out, in and out, ever<br>renewing us, ever anew making us<br>one with all who breathe the same<br>air, may this blessing overf low<br>into a shared gratefulness, so that<br>with one breath I may praise and<br>celebrate life.<br><br>3<br>S O U R C E O F A L L B L E S S I N G S ,<br>you bless us every moment with<br>countless h i d d e n t h i n g s on<br>which our well- being depends,<br>though we will never know them&#x2014;<br>from the water veins hidden deep<br>in the earth to the bacteria that<br>help us digest our food.

But it is also an ancient book about people and cultures very different than us. Thus, while we know we should read it, many of us have a hard time understanding the Bible. In this updated edition of <em>Knowing Scripture,</em> R. C. Sproul helps us dig out the meaning of Scripture for ourselves. The author says, "The theme of this book is not how to <em>read</em> the Bible but how to <em>study</em> the Bible." He presents in simple, basic terms a commonsense approach to studying Scripture and gives eleven practical guidelines for biblical interpretation and applying what we learn. With a minimum of technical jargon, Sproul tackles some of the knotty questions regarding differences of interpreting the Bible, including <ul><li>discovering the meanings of biblical words</li><li>understanding Hebrew poetry, proverbs and parables</li><li>approaching historical and didactic passages</li><li>being careful with predictive prophecy</li><li>discerning how culture conditions the Bible</li><li>choosing and using Bible translations, commentaries, Bible software and other helps</li></ul><em>Knowing Scripture</em> is a basic book for both beginning Bible readers and experienced students of Scripture.</p><p>R. C. Sproul (PhD, Whitefield Theological Seminary) is founder and chairman of Ligonier Ministries, an international Christian education ministry located near Orlando, Florida. He is also co-pastor of Saint Andrew's Chapel in Sanford, Florida, chancellor of Reformation Bible College and executive editor of <em>Tabletalk</em> magazine. He can be heard on the radio program <em>Renewing Your Mind</em>, which is broadcast on hundreds of radio outlets in the United States and around the world. Sproul has written more than ninety books, including <em>The Holiness of God</em>, <em>Faith Alone</em> and <em>Everyone's a Theologian</em>. He has contributed dozens of articles to national evangelical publications, has spoken at conferences, churches and schools around the world, and also serves as general editor of the <em>Reformation Study Bible</em>.Robertson Dean&#39;s masterful narration brings what could otherwise be a dry subject to life. With seamless narratives and attention to detail he delivers Sproul&#39;s lessons on how to read the Bible. Dean&#39;s perfect timing lays the practical groundwork for personal study of the scriptures and equips listeners to dig out underlying biblical meanings with discernment and common sense. With clarity Dean exposes two common myths noted by the author: The Bible is too difficult to understand without theological training and the Bible is boring, outdated, and irrelevant to our time. As the author discusses why the Bible should be studied and provides rules of interpretation for lay readers, Dean portrays the historical biblical narrative, as well as biblical culture, principles, and customs, with authenticity. Sproul&#39;s teaching is a valuable resource for church, Sunday school, or individual use.

Have you watched with frustration as your boy flounders with girls?<br>&nbsp;<br>Welcome to Boy World. It&#x2019;s a place where asking for help or showing emotional pain often feels impossible. Where sports and video games can mean everything, but working hard in school frequently earns ridicule from &#x201c;the guys&#x201d; even as they ask to copy assignments. Where &#x201c;masterminds&#x201d; dominate and friends ruthlessly insult each other but can never object when someone steps over the line. Where hiding problems from adults is the ironclad rule because their involvement only makes situations worse. Boy world is governed by social hierarchies and a powerful set of unwritten rules that have huge implications for your boy&#x2019;s relationships, his interactions with you, and the man he&#x2019;ll become. If you want what&#x2019;s<i> </i>best for him, you need to know what these rules are and how to work with them effectively.<br>&nbsp;<br>What you&#x2019;ll find in <i>Masterminds and Wingmen </i>is critically important for every parent &#x2013; or <i>anyone </i>who cares about boys &#x2013; to know. Collaborating with a large team of middle- and high-school-age editors, Rosalind Wiseman has created an unprecedented guide to the life your boy is <i>actually</i> experiencing &#x2013; his on-the-ground reality.&nbsp; Not only does Wiseman challenge you to examine your assumptions, she offers innovative coping strategies aimed at helping your boy develop a positive, authentic, and strong sense of self.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Rosalind Wiseman</b></p> <p><strong>Q. Why turn your attention to boys? Haven&#x2019;t they always been in an advantageous position? What has changed?</strong></p> <p>A. While in some ways it seems indisputable that boys have an advantage over girls, it depends on how you define &#x201c;advantage.&#x201d; Yes, some boys have social status and power that enables them to silence others&#x2014;boys and girls alike. Some boys can use their advantage to hurt others and not be held accountable. But I don&#x2019;t think of it as advantage per se because it&#x2019;s impossible to have meaningful connections and relationships with other people when you feel entitled to use those people. And in regards to many boys in middle and high school who&#x2019;ve barely started puberty, if you asked them who has more advantage, them or the ninth-grade girl who looks like she&#x2019;s eighteen, they&#x2019;d laugh at you. To them it seems as if girls have all the power.</p> <p><strong>Q. I know you wrote this book with boy editors from every walk of life&#x2014;were you surprised by what the guys revealed to you?</strong></p> <p>A. Yes! I knew that boys had complex emotional lives, but there was a lot I didn&#x2019;t know. For example, it&#x2019;s funny, but boys hate it when their parents pick them up from school or practice and ask a million questions. Other things I learned are more serious. I didn&#x2019;t realize how often adults dismiss boys&#x2019; feelings, or that boys regularly have experiences where people assume they&#x2019;re either hormone-crazed jerks or lazy slackers&#x2014;or both. I also didn&#x2019;t realize how complicated lying is in &#x201c;Boy World.&#x201d; Boys lie for many different reasons and our (adult) responses when we catch boys doing it need to reflect an understanding of the reason they lied in the first place. If we don&#x2019;t understand it, we can&#x2019;t impart whatever values we want to teach boys.</p> <p>It also surprised me that so many boys and young men volunteered to help me with this project. Within six months I had more than 150 boys, aged eight to twenty-four, signed on as editors. They came from all over the country and every walk of life: private East Coast boarding schools, New Orleans&#x2019;s 7th and 9th ward public schools, working-class communities in the Midwest, Southern California suburbs, and every other type of educational environment imaginable. These boys assisted me throughout the writing process to make sure the book was accurate and relevant and captured the lives they really lead.</p> <p><strong>Q. How do you think this book will help parents to assist boys in navigating the middle and high school years? </strong></p> <p>A. I am hoping it will make parents realize that behind a boy&#x2019;s silence or glib assurance that &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine&#x201d; is a person with deep emotional needs&#x2014;one who wants meaningful relationships with adults whom he can believe in. Parents can support the emotional lives of their sons without making them soft or unable to handle life&#x2019;s challenges and hardships. Giving boys the skills to be socially competent when they&#x2019;re in conflict or upset with someone is the way for them to be truly secure. The boys want and need this support. I hope this book will help move the conversation forward.</p> <p><strong>Q. What can teachers, coaches, and school administrators get from this book?</strong></p> <p>A. First and foremost, they&#x2019;ll gain an appreciation of how critical they are in helping boys to believe what honorable, courageous men they truly can be. Boys often see how hypocritical adults can be, and that disillusionment can make a boy not follow his passions. It can make him disengage from the things and people he values most. Every day, educators have the opportunity to be role models of what it looks like to be just, fair, and honorable. They also have the opportunity to be bullies, abusers of power, and cowards. I want educators to read <em>Masterminds</em> and really hear what the boys are saying about the two kinds of men that exist in their lives, and having heard it, to strive to do their best for the boys in their charge.</p>Rosalind Wiseman is a teacher, thought leader and bestselling author of <i>Queen Bees &amp; Wannabees </i>(the book that inspired the movie and musical Mean Girls) and&nbsp;<i>Masterminds &amp; Wingmen,</i> as well as the curriculum <i>Owning Up: Empowering Adolescents to Confront Social Cruelty, Bullying, and Injustice</i>.

A pie-in-the-sky fantasy? Not so, says family psychologist and bestselling author John Rosemond. <br> <br>In the 1960s, American parents stopped listening to their elders when it came to child rearing and began listening instead to professional experts. Since then, raising children has become fraught with anxiety, stress, and frustration. The solution, says John, lies in raising children according to biblical principles, the same principles that guided parents successfully for hundreds of years. They worked then, and they still work now! <br> <br>In this book you&#x2019;ll find practical, Bible-based advice that will help you be the parent you want to be, with children who will be, as the Bible promises, &#x201c;a delight to your soul&#x201d; (Prov. 29:17).</p><p>John Rosemond is a family psychologist who has directed mental-health programs and been in full-time private practice working with families and children. Since 1990, he has devoted his time to speaking and writing. Rosemond&#x2019;s weekly syndicated parenting column now appears in some 250 newspapers, and he has written 15 best-selling books on parenting and the family. He is one of the busiest and most popular speakers in the field, giving more than 200 talks a year to parent and professional groups nationwide. He and his wife of 39 years, Willie, have two grown children and six well-behaved grandchildren.&nbsp;Parenting by the Book <br><br>Chapter One<p></p>The Walls Come<br> Crumblin&#x2019; Down<p></p> <br><br>Blessed is the man who makes the LORD his trust.<br> <br>&#x2014;PSALM 40:4<br><br>Our journey begins in 2002, in Lafayette, Louisiana. I&#x2019;m in the lobby of an auditorium in which I&#x2019;m about to speak, chatting with several parents. One of the women suddenly says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m absolutely convinced, John, that my husband and I have experienced more problems in four years with two children than my parents had with all ten of us the entire time.&#x201d;<br> <br>That mother&#x2019;s statement reflects the difficulties inherent in today&#x2019;s child-rearing philosophy and practice. Further, it echoes not just the experience of one set of parents in Lafayette, but the experience of many if not most parents in the United States. Whether you grew up in a large or small family, you are almost certainly experiencing more child-rearing difficulties than did your parents&#x2014;a lot more. When compared to your grandparents&#x2019; child-rearing experience, there is no doubt about it. Your grandparents had problems with their children&#x2014;all parents do&#x2014;but compared to the problems you are having, their parenting experience was a cakewalk.<br> <br>Men and women who accomplished most of their child rearing before 1960&#x2014;people who are now in their seventies, eighties, and nineties&#x2014;tell me that whereas they dealt with the occasional problem, the raising of children per se was not especially difficult. As one ninety-year-old woman who raised five children during the forties and fifties once told me, &#x201c;It was just something you did.&#x201d; She was by no means diminishing the responsibility. She made it clear that raising children was the most important job anyone ever undertook. She was simply putting it in its proper perspective: Raising children was but one of many responsibilities she had assumed as an adult, and she had been determined to execute each and every one of them to the best of her ability. These included responsibilities as a daughter, sister, friend, wife, employee (she had worked as a secretary for a number of years), member of various women&#x2019;s clubs and civic organizations, and member of her church. Because she did not overidentify with the role of mother, she was not overfocused on her kids. Therefore, raising children did not consume, exasperate, and exhaust her. She was able to discharge her responsibilities to her children, including their discipline, in a calm, collected, confident fashion. That hardly describes the day-to-day experience of today&#x2019;s oft-consumed, oft-exasperated, and oft-exhausted parents, and mothers especially.<br> The Times, They are A-Changin&#x2019;<p></p> <br>&#x201c;But, John!&#x201d; someone might exclaim. &#x201c;Times have changed!&#x201d;<br> <br>That clich� really explains nothing. &#x201c;Times&#x201d; have always changed, but until recently, the raising of children did not change from generation to generation. As technology, demographics, and economic conditions changed, the general approach to child rearing remained pretty much the same. My grandparents, for example, were born in the 1890s. During the first thirty years of their lives, they witnessed and experienced more change&#x2014;in every conceivable fashion&#x2014;than has occurred in the last thirty years (since 1977). Yet child rearing did not change during that time. My parents were born around 1920. Consider the dramatic changes that took place during the first thirty years of their lives, from 1920 to 1950: a worldwide depression that lasted more than a decade, a global war that lasted for five years, the development and use of nuclear weapons, the start of the Cold War and the national insecurity that resulted, the invention of television, and the ubiquity of the automobile. These events transformed not only America, but the world. No one born after 1950 has experienced such profound cultural transformation. Yet from 1920 to 1950, child rearing in America did not change in any appreciable way. My grandparents raised my parents in accord with the same child-rearing principles that had guided my great-grandparents, and they employed pretty much the same methods. My point: The mere fact that &#x201c;times&#x201d; change neither means nor requires change in every single thing.<br> <br>Once upon a time, people understood that in changing times, certain things should not change; that there must always be certain constants in culture. A short list of those changeless things includes consensus concerning morality, the need for adults to be contributing members of society, and constants regarding how the family should function, including how children should be brought up. Once upon a time, people understood that change would deteriorate into chaos unless change was organized around unchanging &#x201c;still points&#x201d; in the culture, and child rearing was one of those points. In fact, there is no evidence that in the Judeo-Christian world the fundamental principles governing child rearing had appreciably changed since its founding by Abraham and Sarah. For thousands of years, the child-rearing &#x201c;baton&#x201d; was handed down, intact, from generation to generation. Children honored their parents by growing up and raising their children the same way their parents had raised them, and let there be no doubt: the &#x201c;way&#x201d; in question was based on biblical principles.1<br><br>Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.<br> <br>&#x2014;EXODUS 20:12 <br><br>Progress constantly infuses culture with new energy, but in the fifth commandment God promises a stable, secure society to people who adhere to fundamental family traditions. But that understanding went by the boards in the 1960s, the single most deconstructive decade in the history of the United States of America.<br> <br>Something New under the Sun<br> <br>During the 1960s, the United States underwent a culture-wide paradigm shift that had profound effect on all of our institutions, including the family. Before the sixties, we were a culture informed by and defined by tradition. Progress took place in nearly every generation, but most people continued to embrace traditional values and live their lives according to traditional form. When young people reached adulthood, developed occupations, married, and had children, they adopted their parents&#x2019; values and consciously sought to emulate their parents&#x2019; examples. (Exceptions to any general rule can always be found, but this was certainly a general rule.) There had been a minor challenge to this constancy after World War I, but it came completely undone in the 1960s. America entered the 1960s one culture and emerged from that tumultuous decade a different culture altogether, in every respect. By 1970, we were no longer a culture informed and defined by tradition, but a culture informed and defined by a relatively new electronic medium&#x2014;television&#x2014;a medium that had decided to promote a radical, progressive agenda.<br> <br>During television&#x2019;s infancy in the 1950s, television programs, without exception, reflected traditional American values. Perhaps you&#x2019;re old enough to remember (or perhaps you&#x2019;ve seen the reruns) I Love Lucy, The Donna Reed Show, Father Knows Best, Leave It to Beaver, Lassie, Walt Disney Presents, and variety shows like The Ed Sullivan Show.<br> <br>In the 1960s, however, the now-adolescent television industry began to take on a rebellious, activist character. Its movers and shakers became determined to use the influence of television to reshape America consistent with the vision of the emerging neoliberal, secular elite. And they succeeded.<br> <br>By 1970, the consensus that had previously existed concerning values, right versus wrong, and morality had begun to unravel. All of the &#x201c;still points&#x201d; that had previously stabilized America had been undermined and were beginning to topple.<br> <br>By the mid-1970s, the United States had become a full-fledged &#x201c;progressive&#x201d; culture. Progressivism holds that just as most new technologies (such as computers) are better than old technologies (typewriters), new ideas are better than old ideas. For the most part, the progressive mind-set rejects tradition. It refuses to recognize that there is, in truth, &#x201c;nothing new under the sun,&#x201d; as a wise man wrote thousands of years ago: &#x201c;What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun&#x201d; (Ecclesiastes 1:9).<br> <br>Many in my generation&#x2014;the Baby Boomers&#x2014;became seduced by the new utopian progressivism. We (as a much younger man, I identified with this movement) deluded ourselves into thinking that we had been anointed by some secular divinity to usher out everything old and ring in a Brave New World. We decided that traditional values and forms had to go&#x2014;that our parents&#x2019; values were most definitely not going to be our values, and their ways of doing things were most definitely not going to be our ways. One of the old ways in question was traditional child rearing.<br> <br>Grandma&#x2019;s Homespun Wisdom<br> <br>Before the 1960s, when parents had problems with their children, they did not seek advice from people with capital letters after their names. Rather, they sought the counsel of elders in their extended families, churches, and communities. &#x201c;Grandma&#x201d;&#x2014;the generic term I use to refer to the elders in question&#x2014;was the universally recognized child-rearing expert. Grandma gave child-rearing advice based on the life she had led. Furthermore, the advice she gave concerning any given parenting problem was the same advice her mother would have given her under similar circumstances, and the same advice her grandmother would have given her mother, and so on down the generations.<br> <br>After the 1960s, parents were no longer going to Grandma for child-rearing advice. Instead, they were seeking counsel from people in the mental health professions&#x2014;people who dispensed advice based not on lives they had led, but rather on books they had read.<br> <br>Understanding what Grandma was talking about did not require a college degree. She did not say things like, &#x201c;In talking with you, I get the distinct impression that you are still trying to resolve childhood issues of your own, and I think we should give some time to exploring those issues and discovering how they relate to the problems you are currently having with your child.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s how people with capital letters after their names talk.<br> <br>Grandma talked like this: &#x201c;You know, it occurs to me that your uncle Charlie, when he was about Billy&#x2019;s age, did something similar to what Billy has done. Here&#x2019;s how I handled it.... You&#x2019;ve no doubt noticed that Charlie is working for the bank today, not robbing banks. Maybe you&#x2019;d like to consider going home and doing with Billy what I did with Charlie.&#x201d;<br> <br>Young parents left their &#x201c;therapy sessions&#x201d; with Grandma feeling empowered and reassured, and with a clear sense of what to do. I was in private practice from 1980 to 1990. One of the sobering things that slowly dawned on me during those ten years was that parents were not always leaving their first appointments with me feeling empowered and reassured, and with a clear sense of what to do. Instead, they were sometimes leaving feeling like miserable failures because, instead of dealing with them as Grandma would have, I was doing so from behind the mask of my impressive credentials. Instead of presenting myself as simply a not-so-remarkable person who had gained some measure of wisdom as a result of my own experiences while raising children, I was presenting myself as a high and mighty, all-knowing, all-seeing psychologist. That realization eventually helped me realize I could be much more helpful to parents outside the office than if I stayed within the protection of its four diploma-ridden walls.<br> Destroying the Foundations<p></p> <br>One of the changes that took place in the 1960s concerned America&#x2019;s attitude toward authority. Before that deconstructive decade, Americans generally respected traditional authority. A person might not have agreed with a certain politician, for example, but he still respected him. He had, after all, been duly elected, and that was that. By 1970, a cynicism and general disrespect had developed toward all forms of traditional authority, of which there are five: political, military, institutional, church, and family.<br> <br>In the late sixties and early seventies, the secular, educational, and media elites began to demonize political authority, the military, institutional authority (especially within corporations), religion (especially Christianity), and the two cornerstones of the traditional family: the traditional marriage and traditional child rearing. Mind you, all of those authority traditions derived their legitimacy from the Bible. In effect, this was an assault on the very Judeo-Christian principles upon which Western civilization was built.<br> <br>The attack on the traditional family was especially vicious. Psychologists and other mental health professionals allied with neofeminists to characterize the traditional family as the primary institution through which the so-called &#x201c;patriarchy&#x201d; exerted its domination of women and manipulation of children. This, they believed, ensured that girls would grow up willing to be dominated by men who had been trained as boys to disrespect and dominate females. Feminists equated traditional marriage with slavery and promoted &#x201c;open&#x201d; marriages in which neither party was obligated to be faithful. Feminists and the increasingly female-dominated mental health elite joined with the media to demonize men as natural aggressors. The 1950s father who might have worked two jobs was characterized not as responsible, wanting the best for his family, but as &#x201c;remote,&#x201d; a guy who really cared little about either his wife or his kids, a guy who in fact used his money and physical superiority to keep them in line. Finally, mental health professionals such as psychologist Thomas Gordon, author of Parent Effectiveness Training (Wyden, 1970), the best-selling parenting book of the era, claimed that traditional child rearing suffocated the &#x201c;natural child&#x201d; and produced instead a child who was destined to become nothing more than a mindless cog in the evil capitalist machine. In one of his books, Gordon actually claimed that the traditional exercise of parental authority was a moving force behind war!2 Such was the progressive, deconstructionist hysteria on which all too many baby boomers, including a much younger John Rosemond, became intoxicated.<br> <br>The Doctor Is In<br> <br>During the 1960s, the television industry began to identify psychologists and other mental health professionals as the only legitimate purveyors of sound child-rearing advice. This trend had its beginnings not, as many think, with Dr. Benjamin Spock (a pediatrician), but with the elevation of psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers to the status of a cultural icon. After winning The $64,000 Question (the 1950s&#x2013;60s equivalent of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?) in 1955, Brothers became a regular talking head on all manner of television programs. She even had her own show for a time. The networks held her up as an expert on anything and everything concerning human behavior and relationships, including how to raise children properly, and the American public listened credulously to anything and everything she had to say.<br> <br>Psychologists and other mental health professionals rushed to hitch a ride on Brothers&#x2019;s coattails. Gordon&#x2019;s Parent Effectiveness Training (P.E.T.) seminars trained thousands of psychologists, family counselors, and clinical social workers in his ideas and methods. In turn, this horde of true believers shared Gordon&#x2019;s utopian child-rearing vision with millions of gullible American parents.

What about three moose, munching on spruce? Bright, spirited illustrations by Jane Chapman enhance this one-of-a-kind counting tale by Phyllis Root &#x2014; a feast of sounds and numbers that will have listeners scrambling to join in the slippy, sloppy fun.</p><p>"Splish, clomp, pleep, plop, plunk, sloosh, slosh, slink, zing." Who can resist a read-aloud featuring sounds like these? When, "Down by the marsh, by the sleepy, slimy marsh, one duck gets stuck in the muck," who comes to the rescue? Two fish, splishing, for starters. Then three moose clomping, four crickets pleeping, and so on. Still, "No luck. Still stuck." It takes a whole lot of teamwork to get this particular stuck duck unstuck from the muck, but this cheerful bunch is definitely up to the task.<p> From one duck to 10 dragonflies, the muddy fun never stops in Phyllis Root's chunky little board book. Young readers will giggle their way through the numbers, and by the time the duck's foot is released with a "Spluck!" counting will be a cinch. Jane Chapman's lush illustrations are full of marshy colors and muddy detail. The right side of each two-page spread shows the hapless duck earnestly waiting for liberation by its lively rescuers, while on the opposite side the featured number is printed, large and bold, over the text, and the splishers and ploppers are depicted again for easy counting. Chapman's enchanting art is also found in <i>The Emperor's Egg</i>, among other titles, and Root's other popular stories include <i>Kiss the Cow!</i>.

Her giants have risen-all of them-and they're stronger than ever. They must be stopped before the Feast of Spes, when Gaea plans to have two demigods sacrificed in Athens. She needs their blood-the blood of Olympus-in order to wake. <br><br>The demigods are having more frequent visions of a terrible battle at Camp Half-Blood. The Roman legion from Camp Jupiter, led by Octavian, is almost within striking distance. Though it is tempting to take the Athena Parthenos to Athens to use as a secret weapon, the friends know that the huge statue belongs back on Long Island, where it <i>might</i> be able to stop a war between the two camps.<br><br>The Athena Parthenos will go west; the <i>Argo II</i> will go east.

I&#x2019;ll never forget how I showed up on my first day, wearing an elegant blue suit bought for the occasion, with Oxford lace-up shoes to match. My girlfriend had given me a sleek, soft briefcase of the sort bankers carried around. As I strode through the front doors of the office in posh Devonshire House, right near Piccadilly, I looked the part, but felt intimidated.<br> <br>I yearned to make a mark, so I followed what I thought was a brilliant strategy: I would work crazy hours. I didn&#x2019;t have much relevant work experience&#x2014;heck, I didn&#x2019;t have any. It was my first real job. I was twenty-four years old and had just finished a master&#x2019;s degree in finance from the London School of Economics. What I lacked in experience I would make up for by staying late in the office. Over the next three years, I worked sixty, seventy, eighty, even ninety hours per week. I drank an endless stream of weak British coffee and survived on a supply of chocolate bars I kept in my top drawer. It got to the point where I knew the names of the cleaning staff who arrived at five in the morning. As you can imagine, my girlfriend soon wanted the briefcase back.<br> <br>One day, as I struggled through an intense merger and acquisition project, I happened upon some slides created by a teammate (I&#x2019;ll call her Natalie). Paging through her analysis, I confronted an uncomfortable truth. Natalie&#x2019;s work was better than mine. Her analysis contained crisper insights, more compelling ideas. Her slides boasted a clean, elegant layout that was more pleasing to the eye and easier to comprehend&#x2014;which in turn made her analysis even more persuasive. Yet one evening in the office, when I went to look for her, she wasn&#x2019;t there. I asked a guy sitting near her desk where she was, and he replied that she&#x2019;d gone home for the night. He explained that Natalie never worked late. She worked from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. No nights, no weekends. That upset me. We were both talented and had the analytical capability required of BCG consultants. She had no more experience in the field than I did. Yet she did better while working less.<br> <br>Three years later, I left BCG to embark on an academic career. I earned a Ph.D. from Stanford University and went on to become a professor at Harvard Business School. From time to time, I found myself thinking back to what I called the &#x201c;Natalie Question&#x201d;: Why had she performed better in fewer hours? She must have carried some secrets explaining her results. I began to wonder about performance in general and decided to focus my research on corporate performance.<br> <br>Starting in 2002, Jim Collins and I spent nine years working on our book Great by Choice as a sequel to Jim&#x2019;s Good to Great.1 Both books offer empirically validated frameworks that account for great performance in companies. That&#x2019;s nice if you&#x2019;re leading a business, but what about the rest of us? After we finished the project, I decided to develop a similarly validated framework for individual performance. It was time to discover why Natalie had done better than I, and more generally, to tackle the big question: why do some people perform great at work while others don&#x2019;t?<br> <br>Social scientists and management experts explain performance at work by pointing to people&#x2019;s innate gifts and natural strengths. How often have you heard phrases like &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a natural at sales&#x201d; or &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a brilliant engineer&#x201d;? One influential book titled The War for Talent argues that a company&#x2019;s ability to recruit and retain talent determines its success.2 The popular StrengthsFinder approach advocates that you find a job that taps into your natural strengths, and then focus on developing those further.3 These talent-based explanations are deeply embedded in our perceptions of what makes for success. But are they right?<br> <br>Some work experts take issue with the talent view. They argue that an individual&#x2019;s sustained effort is just as critical or even more so in determining success.4 In one variant of this &#x201c;work hard&#x201d; paradigm, people perform because they have grit, persevering against obstacles over the long haul.5 In another, people maximize efforts by doing more: they take on many assignments and are busy running to lots of meetings. That&#x2019;s the approach I subscribed to while at BCG, where I put in long hours in an effort to accomplish more. Many people believe that working harder is key to success.6<br> <br>Talent, effort, and also luck undoubtedly explain why some succeed and others don&#x2019;t, but I wasn&#x2019;t satisfied with these arguments. They didn&#x2019;t account for why Natalie performed better than I, nor did they explain the performance differences I had observed between equally hardworking and talented people.<br> <br>I decided to take a different approach, exploring whether the way some people work&#x2014;their specific work practices as opposed to the sheer amount of effort they exert&#x2014;accounts for greatness at work. That led me to explore the idea of &#x201c;working smart,&#x201d; whereby people seek to maximize output per hour of work. The phrase &#x201c;work smarter, not harder&#x201d; has been thrown around so much that it has become a clich�. Who wants to &#x201c;work dumb&#x201d;? But many people do in fact work dumb because they don&#x2019;t know exactly how to work smart. And I don&#x2019;t blame them, because it&#x2019;s hard to obtain solid guidance.<br> <br>I scanned for existing advice on how to work smarter, and the picture I arrived at was incoherent and overwhelming. Every author seemed to say something different. Prioritize. Delegate. Keep a calendar. Avoid distractions. Set clear goals. Execute better. Influence people. Inspire. Manage up. Manage down. Network. Tap into passion. Find a purpose. The list went on, more than 100 pieces of advice.<br> <br>So what is really going on? If Natalie worked smarter than I, what exactly did she and other top performers do? What secrets to their great performance do they harbor? I decided to find out. After years of study, what I found surprised me a great deal and shattered conventional wisdom.<br> <br>THE PERFORMANCE STUDY<br> <br>In 2011, I launched one of the most comprehensive research projects ever undertaken on individual performance at work. I recruited a team of researchers with expertise in statistical analysis and began generating a framework&#x2014;a set of hypotheses about which specific behaviors lead to high performance. I considered the scattered findings I had found in more than 200 published academic studies, and I incorporated insights from my previous discussions with hundreds of managers and executives. I also drew on in-depth interviews with 120 professionals and undertook a 300-person survey pilot. In the final step, we tested the emerging framework in a survey study of 5,000 managers and employees.<br> <br>To organize the vast array of potential &#x201c;work smart&#x201d; factors, I grouped them into categories that scholars regard as important for job performance. We can think of work as consisting of job design characteristics (what a person is supposed to do), skill development (how a person improves), motivational factors (why a person exerts effort), and relational dimensions (with whom and how a person interacts). Once I had settled on these broad categories, I examined factors within each, identifying those that previous research suggested were key. (The research appendix contains details on our methodology.)<br> <br>With this initial list of factors in hand, my team and I designed a 96-item survey instrument, piloting it with a sample of 300 bosses and employees. We also tracked how many hours people worked each week, and we measured their performance relative to their peers. That way, we could compare the effects of hours worked and our &#x201c;work smart&#x201d; factors on performance. We spent months poring over statistical results from the pilot and our notes from in-depth interviews. We winnowed down the number of plausible factors until we arrived at eight main factors. After some more analysis, we discovered that two were similar, so we combined them into one (see the research appendix for further explanation).<br> <br>In the end, we discovered that seven &#x201c;work smart&#x201d; practices seemed to explain a substantial portion of performance. (It always seems to be seven, doesn&#x2019;t it?) When you work smart, you select a tiny set of priorities and make huge efforts in those chosen areas (what I call the work scope practice). You focus on creating value, not just reaching preset goals (targeting). You eschew mindless repetition in favor of better skills practice (quality learning). You seek roles that match your passion with a strong sense of purpose (inner motivation). You shrewdly deploy influence tactics to gain the support of others (advocacy). You cut back on wasteful team meetings, and make sure that the ones you do attend spark vigorous debate (rigorous teamwork). You carefully pick which cross-unit projects to get involved in, and say no to less productive ones (disciplined collaboration). This is a pretty comprehensive list. The first four relate to mastering your own work, while the remaining three concern mastering working with others.<br> <br>NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED<br> <br>These seven practices upend conventional thinking about how you should work. I had thought, for instance, that people who prioritized well would perform well, and they did, but the best performers in our study also did something else. Once they had focused on a few priorities, they obsessed over those tasks to produce quality work. That extreme dedication to their priorities created extraordinary results. Top performers did less and more: less volume of activities, more concentrated effort. This insight overturns much conventional thinking about focusing that urges you to choose a few tasks to prioritize. Choice is only half of the equation&#x2014;you also need to obsess. This finding led us to reformulate the &#x201c;work scope&#x201d; practice and call it &#x201c;do less, then obsess.&#x201d;<br> <br>Our findings also overturned another convention. How many times have you heard, &#x201c;Do what you love&#x201d;? Find a role that taps into your passion, and you will be energized and do a better job. Sure enough, we found that people who were highly passionate about their jobs performed better. But we also came across passionate people who didn&#x2019;t perform well, and people whose passion led them astray (like the poor guy who pursued his passion for graphics design and ended up running down his retirement account and having no job and no income). &#x201c;Follow your passion,&#x201d; we found, can be dangerous advice. Our top performers took a different approach: they strove to find roles that contributed value to the organization and society, and then matched passion with that sense of purpose. The matching of passion and purpose, and not passion alone, produced the best results.<br> <br>Our results overturned yet another typical view, the idea that collaboration is necessarily good and that more is better. Experts advise us to tear down &#x201c;silos&#x201d; in organizations, collaborate more, build large professional networks, and use lots of high-tech communication tools to get work done. Well, my research shows that convention to be dead wrong. Top performers collaborate less. They carefully choose which projects and tasks to join and which to flee, and they channel their efforts and resources to excel in the few chosen ones. They discipline their collaboration.<br> <br>Our study also disputes the popular idea that the path to top performance lies in practicing a skill for 10,000 hours.7 Our best performers in the workplace did something else, practicing what I call the &#x201c;learning loop&#x201d; at work, as we&#x2019;ll discuss in chapter four.<br> <br>These and other surprising insights turned out to be critical. The very best people didn&#x2019;t just work smart in a conventional sense, but pursued more nuanced practices, like doing less and obsessing, and matching purpose with passion. Comparing these seven practices, I realized that they all embodied the idea of selectivity. Whenever they could, top performers carefully selected which priorities, tasks, collaborations, team meetings, committees, analyses, customers, new ideas, steps in a process, and interactions to undertake, and which to neglect or reject. Yet this more nuanced way of working smart wasn&#x2019;t just about being selective. The very best redesigned their work so that they would create the most value (a term we will define in chapter three) and then they applied intense, targeted efforts in their selected work activities.<br> <br>Based on these findings, I arrived at a more precise definition of working smart: To work smart means to maximize the value of your work by selecting a few activities and applying intense targeted effort.<br> <br>TESTING THE NEW THEORY<br> <br>To test our framework of the seven work-smart practices, my team and I modified our survey instrument and administered it to 5,000 managers and employees across a wide range of jobs and industries in corporate America. We sampled bosses and direct reports in addition to employees, so as not to rely on self-reported data only (see the research appendix for details). We surveyed sales reps, lawyers, trainers, actuaries, brokers, medical doctors, software programmers, engineers, store managers, plant foremen, marketers, human resource people, consultants, nurses, and my personal favorite&#x2013;a Las Vegas casino dealer. Some of these people occupied senior positions, but most were supervisors, office managers, department heads, or employees in low-level positions. The 5,000 people represented 15 industry sectors and 22 job functions. Almost half (45 percent) were women (two of the seven practices revealed a gender difference8). Age groups ranged from millennials to those over 50. Education level varied from those with less than a bachelor&#x2019;s degree (20 percent of the sample) to people with a master&#x2019;s degree or higher (22 percent). My aim was to develop, test, and share a smart-work theory that most people could use to improve their individual performance.<br> <br>We ran our 5,000-person data set through a rigorous statistical method called regression analysis. It turned out that our seven work-smart practices went a long way toward explaining differences in performance. In fact, they accounted for a whopping 66 percent of the variation in performance among the 5,000 people in our dataset.9 We can compare that to other fields to get an idea of how remarkable this effect is. Smoking will kill you, we&#x2019;re told, yet smoking only explains 18 percent of variation in people&#x2019;s average life expectancy in the developed world, according to one study.10 Having a good salary is considered crucial for building lifelong financial resources, yet income only explains 33 percent of differences in people&#x2019;s net worth, according to a study of U.S. citizens between ages 18 and 65.11 The basketball star Stephen Curry is famous for hitting three-point shots twenty-two feet away from the basket, yet he has landed &#x201c;just&#x201d; 44 percent of these shots during his professional career.12 These benchmark numbers from other fields indicate how substantial 66 percent really is in explaining an outcome like individual performance.<br> <br>By contrast, other factors we tested such as educational background, company tenure, age, gender, and hours worked combined to account for only 10 percent of the differences in performance. Hours worked per week mattered, but as I&#x2019;ll explain in chapter three, the relationship to performance was more complicated than the simple &#x201c;work harder&#x201d; view sugges...</p><h2>Sacred Hoops: SPIRITUAL LESSONS OF A HARDWOOD WARRIOR</h2><p><strong>With a new introduction, Phil Jackson's modern classic of motivation, teamwork, and Zen insight is updated for a whole new readership</strong><br><br> <em>"Not only is there more to life than basketball, there's a lot more to basketball than basketball."</em> --Phil Jackson<br><br> Eleven years ago, when Phil Jackson first wrote these words in <em>Sacred Hoops</em>, he was the triumphant head coach of the Chicago Bulls, known for his Zen approach to the game.

And of course I did a lot of internet research. So many deep-ocean discoveries are recent, and lots of things haven't made their way into print yet, at least not into books that I could find. There are a lot of high-quality web sites associated with universities or research organizations. One of the hardest parts was figuring out where to do the descent, once I'd decided to do a surface to sea floor journey. I wanted the water temperature, geology and animal life to be accurate for that specific location. Ultimately, I realized that if we were going to go on this trip, we really had to end up in the deepest spot in the sea.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What was the most surprising thing you learned while working on <em>Down, Down, Down</em>?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Probably the thing that got me interested in the first place--the fact that we know so little about the oceans. The longest mountain range in the world--the mid-ocean ridge, which runs for more than 40,000 miles-- was unknown until the 1960s. There are undoubtedly large, still unknown life forms in the oceans.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Which animal was the most challenging to construct?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> The siphonophore--both lights on and lights off.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you think accounts for both adults' and kids' long-abiding fascination with the ocean and its creatures?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> As a species, we are intrigued with the unknown. It's one reason we've done so well, and inhabit almost every corner of the globe (at least where there's dry land). I think it's the fact that the ocean is at once so inviting (think: a nice day at the beach or a pleasant sailboat trip) and so terrifying (a storm at sea; the dark, cold depths and frightening creatures) makes it especially fascinating. And many of those deep-sea creatures are beyond anything we'd imagined.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Are there certain things a parent/teacher/adult can do to keep the love of science alive in kids? As a parent, what do you do to encourage that love and curiosity in your own children?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Listen to their questions, and if you don&#x2019;t know the answer, look it up together. Buy lots of nonfiction books! Or get them at the library, and read them together. Like so many things--diet, physical activity, a love of art or music--children pay more attention to what we do than what we say. So the first step in encouraging a love of science in children might be to cultivate an interest in it ourselves.

There, I was picked up by a Land Rover driven by a bearded guy who introduced himself as &#x201c;Mr. McGregor, groundskeeper.&#x201d; He looks about a hundred years old, but I am so exhausted that he could drive like he was in Scotland&#x2019;s version of The Fast and the Furious, and I&#x2019;d be fine with it. So long as I&#x2019;m getting closer to Gregorstoun, I&#x2019;m good.<br> &nbsp;<br> There are three other kids in the car with me, two girls and a boy, and all three seem younger than me. They&#x2019;ve stayed close together, murmuring in low voices. I saw them on the train from Edinburgh, huddled together.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was a weird experience, riding the train up, watching the land change from the suburban houses outside the city to the fields, and then stony hills as we got farther north. I was so unsure of what to do that I stayed frozen in my seat the whole time, not even going to look for the bathroom.<br> &nbsp;<br> All three of them keep shooting me looks, and finally, as the Land Rover crests a hill, I turn back to face all of them with a bright smile.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So where do you think the sorting hat will put you?&#x201d; I ask, then lift my hand, twisting two fingers together. &#x201c;Come onnnn, Ravenclaw!&#x201d; I say, and all three of them blink.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. McGregor chuckles. Or maybe he&#x2019;s choking, hard to say. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re American,&#x201d; one of the girls says. She&#x2019;s truly little, with ashy blond hair and giant blue eyes. I can just make out the top of a plastic horse sticking out from one of the pockets on her leather satchel.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Millie.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The girl blinks at me before offering, &#x201c;Elisabeth. Lissie, really. And this is Em&#x201d;&#x2014;she gestures to the dark-haired girl beside her&#x2014;&#x201c;and Olly.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Elisabeth, Em, Olly,&#x201d; I repeat, nodding at each of them. They all smile politely, and okay, sure, they&#x2019;re all like twelve, but maybe this is a good sign of the kind of people I&#x2019;ll meet at Gregorstoun. Maybe they won&#x2019;t all be Scary Rich People, but just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. awkward kids.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rich Awkward Kids, but kids all the same.<br> &nbsp;<br> In any case, the road is leveling out now, and the school is suddenly rising up before us, just like the website only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. real.<br> &nbsp;<br> In front of me.<br> &nbsp;<br> The pictures really didn&#x2019;t do it justice. It&#x2019;s all cream-colored stone against the green, rising up four stories, a long gravel drive in front, windows blinking in the sun.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, wow,&#x201d; I breathe, and Mr. McGregor looks over at me, a twinkle in his eyes if I&#x2019;m not mistaken.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; he agrees. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a sight.&#x201d; Then he sighs, brows drawing together. &#x201c;Used to be my family&#x2019;s home, ya ken, but now I just work here, shuttlin&#x2019; you lot about.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m not really sure what to say to that, so I just sort of hum in agreement and turn my attention back to the school.<br> &nbsp;<br> There are a bunch of students milling around on the lawn, some in uniform, some not. I&#x2019;m still wearing my jeans and T-shirt, since my uniform is supposed to be waiting for me in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Pulling my backpack into my lap, I take out the email I printed out. Room 327, I read, my fingers moving over the numbers. My room. The room I&#x2019;m going to live in for the next year.<br> &nbsp;<br> With another girl.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s one of the weirder parts of this whole boarding school experiment&#x2014;living with someone else. I was an only child up until eighteen months ago, and I&#x2019;ve never shared a space with someone else like this.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, good practice for college, right?<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. McGregor pulls the car up to the front of the school, where there are already kids heading in, dragging huge roller bags. I have a massive suitcase of my own in the back of the Land Rover (gotten on sale at TJ Maxx, thank you very much), and before I know it, I&#x2019;m standing there in the huge front hall of Gregorstoun, the handle of the bag in my hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s chaos, people weaving in and out, and I look around, trying to take it all in, a mix of nerves and jet lag making me feel more anxious than I&#x2019;d anticipated.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m mostly surprised by how many boys there are. All kinds of boys. Boys who look about twelve, boys who tower over me as they make their way into the house. There must be five boys for every one girl, and I wonder just how many of us applied to be part of Gregorstoun&#x2019;s first female class.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ground floor still looks like someone&#x2019;s house. There are paintings on the wall, little tables full of bric-a-brac, and soft carpets underfoot.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ahead of me, a wooden staircase spirals upward, and, swallowing hard, I head toward it, lugging my bag behind me.<br> &nbsp;<br> There are no elevators&#x2014;or lifts, I guess they&#x2019;d call them here&#x2014;so I definitely get my cardio in hauling everything I own up to the third floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s a little less chaotic up here, and dimmer. There are fewer windows, and the carpet underfoot feels almost moldy as I creep along it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ew.<br> &nbsp;<br> But I find Room 327 easy enough, and when I open the door, there&#x2019;s no one in there.<br> &nbsp;<br> Standing on the threshold, I face two twin beds, one dresser, and a desk on either side of the door. In fact, if you open the door all the way, it hits one of the desks, and for some reason, I decide to go ahead and claim that side of the room. That might endear me to my roommate, right? Picking the crappy side?<br> Pulling my suitcase all the way into the room, I sit on the little bed with its scratchy white sheets and green wool blanket. <br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ve done it. I&#x2019;ve come to Scotland, and I&#x2019;m here for the next year.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before the enormity of what I&#x2019;ve done can fully sink in, I whip out my phone, pulling up FaceTime to call Dad.<br> &nbsp;<br> He answers almost immediately, and I grin with relief to see him there in the living room.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You made it!&#x201d; he enthuses, dark eyes crinkling at the cor-ners, and I nod, spinning my phone around so he can see my room.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Living it up in the lap of luxury, obviously,&#x201d; I say, and Anna pops her head in.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh my god, it&#x2019;s so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. quaint,&#x201d; she says, raising her eye-brows, and I wave at her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If quaint means a little creepy and small, then yes!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She frowns slightly, leaning closer to Dad&#x2019;s phone. &#x201c;Millie, if this isn&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d; she starts to say, but then the door to my room flies open again, thumping hard against my desk.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; a voice insists. &#x201c;This is not what was agreed to.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A girl steps into the room followed by a man in a dark suit, and just for a second, my family and my phone are totally for-gotten.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s not cool to stare, I know that, but this is literally the prettiest girl I&#x2019;ve ever seen in my life.<br> &nbsp;<br> She&#x2019;s taller than I am, and her hair is gold. Like. Literally gold, like dark honey. It&#x2019;s held back from her face with a thin headband, and that face&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> &nbsp;<br> I realize while looking at her that beauty is more than just the way your face is structured, the weird quirks of DNA and societal norms that make us say, &#x201c;This nose is the best nose,&#x201d; or &#x201c;This is why I like this mouth,&#x201d; or whatever. This girl has clearly won a genetic lottery, don&#x2019;t get me wrong, but it&#x2019;s not just that&#x2014;it&#x2019;s that she seems to glow. Her skin is so smooth and luminous I want to stroke her face like some kind of weirdo. I&#x2019;m not sure she would even know what the word &#x201c;pore&#x201d; means. Does she follow one of those intense ten-step skin routines? Has she found magical sheet masks made of pearls?<br> &nbsp;<br> Maybe this is just what being rich does to your face. Because there&#x2019;s no doubt this girl is also very, very rich. Her clothes are simple&#x2014;a sweater and jeans tucked into high leather boots&#x2014;but they practically smell like money. She smells like money.<br> &nbsp;<br> Also, only rich people can curl their lips the way she&#x2019;s currently doing at the guy in the suit who followed her in. Her dad? He looks a little young, plus it&#x2019;s hard to imagine that a guy with heavy jowls and pockmarked skin could possibly be related to this actual angel of a girl, standing there with a Louis Vuitton bag in the crook of her elbow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your mother&#x2014;&#x201d; the man starts, and she throws up her hands. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Call her, then.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d; the man asks, his heavy brow wrinkling.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Call my mother,&#x201d; she repeats, her voice carrying just the softest Scottish burr. Her chin is lifted, and I can actually feel tension vibrating off her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We were told&#x2014;&#x201d; the man says on a sigh, but she&#x2019;s not giving in. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Call my mother.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> On my phone, Dad scowls. &#x201c;Everything okay?&#x201d; he asks, and I glance back at my new roommate, still imperiously repeating, &#x201c;Call my mother,&#x201d; every time the man tries to speak. And now I realize he&#x2019;s pulled his phone out, I assume to call her mother, and she&#x2019;s still saying it, over and over again, like a toddler.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Call my mother. Call my mother. Call. My. Mother.&#x201d; Maybe it&#x2019;s jet lag. Maybe it&#x2019;s the weird, weightless feeling in my stomach that started the moment I walked into the school and just what a massive change I&#x2019;d made fully sunk in.<br> &nbsp;<br> But I turn to look over at her, and before I can think better of it, I hear myself say, &#x201c;Hey. Veruca Salt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her lips part slightly, eyebrows going up as she stares at me. &#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ve never wanted to pull words back into my mouth so badly. Lee was right about me not liking confrontation&#x2014;it&#x2019;s pretty much my least favorite thing, right there underneath mayonnaise and jazz music. But something about how this girl is talking just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bugged me.<br> &nbsp;<br> So maybe this is who I am now? Millie Quint, Confronter of People.<br> &nbsp;<br> I decide to keep going with it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you mind being a little quieter?&#x201d; I waggle my phone at her. &#x201c;Some of us are trying to talk, and it seems like my dude here is calling your mom, so, like, maybe take it down a thou-sand notches?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She keeps staring at me, and the man with her is now looking at me, too, his florid face going even redder.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whatever. I take a deep breath and turn back to Dad. &#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;m here, I&#x2019;m safe, everything is great&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ish, and I&#x2019;ll call you back later, okay?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rubbing his eyes, Dad nods. &#x201c;Sounds good, Mils. Love you.&#x201d; &#x201c;Love you, too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He hangs up, and I go back to the suitcase on my bed. I still have a ton of unpacking to do, and it&#x2019;s going to take a lot of work to get this room looking even the littlest bit homey, so I should&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did you really call me Veruca Salt?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I turn around to see my new roommate standing there with her arms folded. The guy who was with her is out in the hall, talking on his cell phone, probably to this girl&#x2019;s mom like she asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> I take a second to study her now that I&#x2019;m not blinded by her bone structure and shiny hair. Her sweater is a pale green that would make anyone else look vaguely ill, but just plays up the gold in her eyes, and yeah, my original take of her being the prettiest girl I&#x2019;ve ever seen holds up, but the sulky way her mouth is turning down kills a little bit of her glow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I did, yeah,&#x201d; I tell her. &#x201c;It seemed like you were about three seconds from launching into a musical number about wanting things, so it just felt right.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her lips purse together, curling up into a smile. &#x201c;Charming,&#x201d; she finally says, then her eyes drop to my jeans&#x2014;nowhere near as nice as hers&#x2014;and my long-sleeved T-shirt. It&#x2019;s the one I got working on the yearbook last year. I&#x2019;d figured there was no sense in dressing up, since we&#x2019;d get our uniforms as soon as we came, but now, next to this girl, I feel a little&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. grubby.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I take it you&#x2019;re my roommate,&#x201d; she says, and I cross my own arms, mimicking her posture.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So it seems.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> That smile again. It&#x2019;s a straight-up Disney villain smile, reminding me that no matter how gorgeous this girl is, she&#x2019;s clearly a witch.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What a delight for us both,&#x201d; she says, and then she turns, flouncing back out of the room.<br> &nbsp;<br> She&#x2019;s probably running to the headmaster to ask to be moved or something, and frankly, that suits me just fine.<br> &nbsp;<br> But hey, maybe school is going to keep us both so busy that I&#x2019;ll hardly even have to see her.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s only after I&#x2019;ve heard her stomping footsteps disappear down the hall that I realize I never learned her name.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 8:</b><br><br> According to the itinerary I was emailed, I have a &#x201c;tea&#x201d; at 4 p.m., and since it&#x2019;s 3 now, I change into my new uniform, which was hanging up in the closet, draped with plastic, when I arrived. There&#x2019;s a knee-length plaid skirt, a short-sleeved white shirt, and two different sweaters, one long-sleeved, the other a vest. I choose that one, the Gregorstoun crest stitched on the front. It&#x2019;s warm enough so I don&#x2019;t have to bother with the dark tights, settling on the kneesocks instead and finally sliding my feet into a pair of very plain black flats.<br> &nbsp;<br> There&#x2019;s a mirror affixed to the back of the door, and I take a moment to look at myself, this new Millie. A Gregorstoun Girl.<br> &nbsp;<br> Same boring brown hair curling over my shoulders, same brown eyes. Same dimples, as I see when I give a forced smile.<br> &nbsp;<br> Same Millie, different place.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sighing, I open the door and step out into the hall, only to immediately hear someone calling out.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you, Perry, she&#x2019;s on this floor!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The voice around the corner is clearly coming from a Disney Princess&#x2014;sweet, melodious, complete with the perfect cut-glass English accent, and I expect the girl I&#x2019;m about to see will look like a cross between Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. There might even be woodland creatures trailing in her wake.<br> &nbsp;<br> The girl who suddenly appears is beautiful, and she&#x2019;s also&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a giant.<br> &nbsp;<br> Okay, that&#x2019;s not really fair, but she is easily over six feet tall, although when I glance down, I see she&#x2019;s wearing high-heeled boots. And while she might not look like Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty, she is beautiful, with long dark hair and smooth brown skin.<br> &nbsp;<br> And when looks down at me, I see she has lovely brown eyes that crinkle at the corners as she smiles. &#x201c;Oh, hullo!&#x201d; she says brightly. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t even see you there!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s probably because I&#x2019;m basically a squirrel while she&#x2019;s a giraffe, and I give an awkward wave. &#x201c;I tend to blend in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re American!&#x201d; she trills, then gestures behind her impatiently. &#x201c;LOOK, PERRY, I&#x2019;VE FOUND AN AMERICAN!&#x201d; she calls, loud enough to...</p><h2>Rubank Elementary Method - Cornet or Trumpet (Rubank Educational Library, 18)</h2><p>(Elementary Method).

Food-related wordplay adds layers to the free verse, as in the lines about the protesters&#x2019; recipe for integration: &#x201c;Combine black with white / to make sweet justice.&#x201d; The double-page spreads in watercolor and thick ink lines show both the scene in Woolworth&#x2019;s and across America as blacks and whites organize sit-ins and watch coverage of protests on TV. Finally, the young people at the counter get what they order, &#x201c;served to them exactly the way they wanted it&#x2013;&#x2013;well done.&#x201d; The recipe metaphors are repetitive, but at the core of the exciting narrative are scenes that show the difficulty of facing hatred: &#x201c;tougher than any school test.&#x201d; Closing pages discuss the role of adults, including Ella Baker and then presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and include a detailed civil rights time line, &#x201c;a final helping&#x201d; about the historic struggle, and a bibliography. Even young children will grasp the powerful, elemental, and historic story of those who stood up to oppressive authority and changed the world. Grades 2-4. --Hazel Rochman</p><h2>H.P.

In this book, J.D. Greear shows how moralism and legalism have often eclipsed the gospel, even in conservative churches.

Is this the love of a lifetime, or the very beginning of a lifetime of love?</p><p>&#34;Going all the way&#34; is still a taboo subject in young adult literature. Judy Blume was the first author to write candidly about a sexually active teen, and she&#39;s been defending teenagers&#39; rights to read about such subjects ever since. Here, Blume tells a convincing tale of first love--a love that seems strong and true enough to last forever. Katherine loves Michael so much, in fact, that she&#39;s willing to lose her virginity to him, and, as the months go by, it gets harder and harder for her to imagine living without him. However, something happens when they are separated for the summer: Katherine begins to have feelings for another guy. What does this mean about her love for Michael? What does this mean about love in general? What does &#34;forever&#34; mean, anyway? As always, Blume writes as if she&#39;s never forgotten a moment of what it&#39;s like to be a teenager.Judy Blume, one of America&#x2019;s most popular authors, is the recipient of the 2004 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.

Only <i>Complete English Grammar Rules</i> gives you key exceptions, common grammar mistakes, thousands of real-world examples, and hundreds of grammar quizzes designed to help you retain what you've learned.<br>With <i>Complete English Grammar Rules</i>, you'll be able to:&nbsp;<ul><li>Quickly master basic English grammar and tackle more advanced topics.</li><li>Properly use every type of noun, verb, and even the most obscure grammar elements.</li><li>Master verb tenses, including irregular verbs and exceptions.</li><li>Avoid embarrassing grammar errors.</li><li>Immediately put your skills into action! Become a more effective writer and communicator in school, at work, and in everyday conversation.</li></ul></p><p>Grammar is without a doubt one of the most daunting aspects of the English language, an area riddled with complexities, inconsistencies, and contradictions. It has also been in a state of flux for pretty much its entire existence. For native speakers of English, as well as for those learning it as a new language, grammar presents a very serious challenge to speaking and writing both accurately and effectively.<br>Having a single, reliable, go-to reference guide should therefore be indispensable to those trying to learn, improve, or perfect their speech or writing. This book is that guide: a clear, unambiguous, and comprehensive source of information that covers all the relevant topics of English grammar, while still being easy to understand and enjoyable to read.<br>Every topic in the book has been broken down into basic units. Each unit can be read and understood in its own right, but throughout the book you will find cross-references to other sections and chapters to help make it clear how all the pieces fit together. If you're having trouble understanding something, try going back (or forward) to other related topics in the book.<br>Finally, it must be mentioned that, because English is such a flexible, inconsistent language, the "rules" that are often bandied about are usually not rules at all, but rather guides that reflect how the language is used. Accordingly, the guidelines contained within this book are just that--guidelines. They are not intended to provide constrictive or proscriptive rules that confine everyone to a particular way of speaking or writing.<br>Learning how the English language works will enhance your engagement with speech and writing every day, from the books you read, to the e-mails you write, to the conversations you have with friends and strangers alike.<br>As such, mastering grammar is not an exercise that is confined to the classroom. While it is certainly important to learn the structures, styles, and rules that shape the language, the key to truly learning English is to read and listen to the way people write and speak every day, from the most well-known authors to the people you talk to on the bus.

She has stories in several anthologies, as well as editorial credits and is currently working on her first stand-alone novel, a dark, mysterious fairy tale.The situation at the Tulsa branch of the vampyre academy House of Night appears to be unraveling: a human is murdered on school grounds; the sudden death of a fledgling vampyre sparks violence within the student body; Old Magic may be corrupting a high-priestess-in-training; and a malevolent former priestess is getting ready to make a serious comeback. Being the eleventh and penultimate book in the House of Night series, this requires serious backstory knowledge to understand the characters, their alliances, and the significance of their actions. For series fans, this is more of the same, and other than a few episodes of physical violence and what seems like a gratuitous lesbian kiss near the end, not much happens to advance the plot or character development. No worries, though&#x2014;some teens will love the vamp connection, the steamy love scenes, and the pop-culture feel of this almost-final chapter.

Follow along as he explores his classroom, makes new friends, and enjoys all the creative and interesting activities school can offer. <i>My First Day of School</i> helps first-time students, from preschoolers to kindergartners, understand what happens at school, while providing parents the opportunity to answer questions their child may have. An enthusiastic narrator and bright, cheerful illustrations will have first-time students eagerly anticipating their first day of school.</p><p>Michelle Medlock Adams began her writing career at a young age as the editor of her elementary school newspaper! As an adult, she became a successful journalist, but when she had two children of her own, she quickly turned to writing children's books. Michelle's many titles include the bestselling What Is . . . holiday series for WorthyKids/Ideals. Michelle divides her time between writing, speaking at conferences, and blogging. She has two grown daughters and lives with her husband, Jeff, in Bedford, Indiana. <br><br>Aside from illustrating, Lizzie Walkley loves decorating her 1940's house and exploring the countryside just outside her door. Walkley studied illustration at Plymouth University and has since worked as an illustrator, with credits including <i>God Made the Sun</i> and <i>God Made the Moon.</i> Walkley lives in England.A cheery white tot experiences the first day of school.In first-person narration conveyed in rhyming couplets, the child dresses in jeans and T-shirt, eats breakfast, gets dropped off by Dad, and joins new classmates for a fun day at school. The child's class has a diverse population, and the book's tone is enthusiastically reassuring. The kids play outside, learn their ABCs, paint, and more. We practice saying 'thanks' and 'please,' / and how to block germs when we sneeze. Here, the kids all earnestly sneeze into their elbows while their teacher, a white woman, holds a box of tissues. All along the children are smiling in the ubiquitous board-book style, but as a balm for school-day jitters, the calm colors and smiling faces are effective. This title isn't a must read, but if a little reader is nervous about going to school this title will do the trick. Judging by the size of the school and the sidewalk drop-off routine, these kids are going to kindergarten rather than preschool, which makes the audience for this board book unclear. Children of an age to require board pages aren't ready for kindergarten, and those who are are mostly accustomed to longer books with paper pages. However, toddler siblings of new kindergartners will enjoy this peek at an older sibling's day. A cute and encouraging primer on what goes down at school.

Anything can happen at Wayside School.<br></p><p>Childhood Memories<br>As writer of books for elementary school students, Louis Sachar tries to recall what it felt like for him to be that age. Despite the notion that times have changed, he thinks that kids in grade school are basically the same as they were when he was young. <br>For example, in East Meadow, New York, where Sachar was born, he remembers having to keep away from the woods across the street to avoid the older, tough kids who played there. Looking back now, he thinks those tough kids were probably only eleven or twelve years old! When Sachar turned nine, his family moved to Orange County in California, which, at the time, was mostly orange groves. He cut through the orange groves on the way to school, and had orange fights on the way home. <br><br>The Path to Becoming an Author<br>It wasn't until high school that Sachar began to love reading. In college, he developed a particular interest in Russian literature and somehow got the ridiculous ambitious notion to learn the language and read his favorite Russian authors in the original language. After taking over a year of Russian, he realized it was still Greek to him. Sachar dropped out of Russian class and tried to figure out what class he should take instead. As he wandered across the campus, he saw an elementary school girl handing out pieces of paper. He took one from her. It read: 'Help. We need teachers' aides at our school. Earn three units of credit.' <br><br>Prior to that time, Sachar had no interest whatsoever in kids. However, he signed up to be a teacher's aide because he needed to take something other than Russian, and it sounded easy. It turned out to be not only his favorite class, but also the most important class Sachar took during his college career. After he was at the school for a while, he was asked to be the 'Noon Time Supervisor.' It was his job to watch over the kids during lunch. Sachar played games with the kids who all called him 'Louis, the Yard Teacher.' <br><br>The Story Behind Sideways Stories<br>Around that time Sachar came upon In Our Town by Damon Runyon, a book of very short stories about different characters in a town. It gave him the idea for Sideways Stories from Wayside School, which is a book of short stories about different kids in a school. All the kids are named after kids he knew at the school where he worked. 'Louis the Yard Teacher,' is also a character. Sachar says he had more fun writing that book than any of his others, because it was just a hobby then, and he never truly expected to be published. <br><br>A Career Choice <br>Sideways Stories from Wayside School was published just as Sachar began law school. For six years he struggled over trying to decide between being an author or a lawyer. During the time that he finished law school and took a job as a lawyer, Sachar wrote three more children's books. His decision had been made. Sachar has been an attorney since 1981, but has chosen to devote his time to writing children's books. <br><br></p><h2>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain: The Deluxe Edition</h2><p>P&gt;<b> The ideal gift for any artist on your list-or a keepsake item of your own! </b><p></p><p><b> A revised edition of the classic drawing book that has sold more than 1.7 million copies in the United States alone.</b></p><p>Translated into more than seventeen languages, <i>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</i> is the world's most widely used drawing instruction book.

Dr. Edwards has been profiled on the <i>Today</i> show and in <i>Time</i>, among other magazines and newspapers. She lives in California.<b>Introduction</b><br><i>Drawing used to be a civilized thing to do, like reading and writing. It was taught in elementary schools. It was democratic. It was a boon to happiness. </i><br>&#x2014;Michael Kimmelman<br><br>For more than thirty years, <i>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</i> has been a work in progress. Since the original publication in 1979, I have revised the book three times, with each revision about a decade apart: the ?rst in 1989, the second, 1999, and now a third, 2012 version. In each revision, my main purpose has been to incorporate instructional improvements that my group of teachers and I had gleaned from continuously teaching drawing over the intervening years, as well as bringing up-to-date ideas and information from education and neuroscience that relate to drawing. As you will see in this new version, much of the original material remains, as it has passed the test of time, while I continue to re?ne the lessons and clarify instructions. In addition, I make some new points about emergent right-brain signi?cance and the astonishing, relatively new science called neuroplasticity. I make a case for my life&#x2019;s goal, the possibility that public schools will once again teach drawing, not only as a civilized thing to do and a boon to happiness, but also as perceptual training for improving creative thinking.<br><br><b>The power of perception</b><br><br>Many of my readers have intuitively understood that this book is not only about learning to draw, and it is certainly not about Art with a capital A. The true subject is <i>perception</i>. Yes, the lessons have helped many people attain the basic ability to draw, and that is a main purpose of the book. But the larger underlying purpose was always to bring right hemisphere functions into focus and to teach readers how to <i>see</i> in new ways, with hopes that they would discover how to transfer perceptual skills to thinking and problem solving. In education, this is called &#x201c;transfer of learning,&#x201d; which has always been regarded as di?cult to teach, and often teachers, myself included, hope that it will just happen. Transfer of learning, however, is best accomplished by direct teaching, and therefore, in Chapter 11 of this revised edition, I encourage that transfer by including some direct instruction on how perceptual skills, learned through drawing, can be used for thinking and problem solving in other ?elds.<br><br>The book&#x2019;s drawing exercises are truly on a basic level, intended for a beginner in drawing. The course is designed for persons who cannot draw at all, who feel that they have no talent for drawing, and who believe that they probably can never learn to draw. Over the years, I have said many times that the lessons in this book are not on the level of art, but are rather more like learning how to read&#x2014;more like the ABCs of reading: learning the alphabet, phonics, syllabi?cation, vocabulary, and so on. And just as learning basic reading is a vitally important goal, because the skills of reading transfer to every other kind of learning, from math and science to philosophy and astronomy, I believe that in time learning to draw will emerge as an equally vital skill, one that provides equally transferrable powers of perception to guide and promote insight into the <i>meaning</i> of visual and verbal information. I will even go out on a limb and say that we mistakenly may have been putting all our educational eggs into one basket only, while shortchanging other truly valuable capabilities of the human brain, namely perception, intuition, imagination, and creativity. Perhaps Albert Einstein put it best: &#x201c;The intuitive mind is a sacred gift, and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.&#x201d;<br><br><b>The hidden content</b><br><br>About six months after publication of the original book in 1979, I had the odd experience of suddenly realizing that the book I thought I had written contained another content of which I was unaware. That hidden content was something I didn&#x2019;t know I knew: I had inadvertently de?ned the basic component skills of the global skill of drawing. I think part of the reason this content was hidden from me was the very nature of art education at the time, where beginning drawing classes focused on subject matter, such as &#x201c;Still Life Drawing,&#x201d; &#x201c;Landscape Drawing,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Figure Drawing,&#x201d; or on drawing mediums, such as charcoal, pencil, pen and ink, ink wash, or mixtures of mediums.<br><br>But my aim was di?erent: I needed to provide my readers with exercises that would cause a cognitive shift to the right hemisphere&#x2014;a shift similar to that caused by Upside-Down Drawing: &#x201c;tricking&#x201d; the dominant left hemisphere into dropping out of the task. I settled on ?ve subskills that seemed to have the same e?ect, but at the time, I thought that there must be other basic skills&#x2014;maybe dozens of them.<br><br>Then, months after the book had been published, in the midst of teaching a class, it hit me as an <i>aha</i>! that for learning to draw realistic images of observed subjects, the ?ve subskills were it&#x2014;there weren&#x2019;t more. I had inadvertently selected from the many aspects of drawing a few fundamental subskills that I thought might be closely aligned to the e?ect of Upside-Down Drawing. And the ?ve skills, I realized, were not drawing skills in the usual sense; they were rock-bottom, fundamental <i>seeing</i> skills: how to perceive edges, spaces, relationship, lights and shadows, and the <i>gestalt</i>. As with the ABCs of reading, these were the skills you had to have in order to draw any subject.<br><br>I was elated by this discovery. I discussed it at length with my colleagues and searched through old and new textbooks on drawing, but we did not ?nd any additional <i>fundamenta</i>l basic components of the global skill of basic realistic drawing&#x2014;drawing one&#x2019;s perceptions. With this discovery, it occurred to me that perhaps drawing could be quickly and easily taught and learned&#x2014; not strung out over years and years, as was the current practice in art schools. My aim suddenly became &#x201c;drawing for everyone,&#x201d; not just for artists in training. Clearly, the basic ability to draw does not necessarily lead to the &#x201c;?ne art&#x201d; found in museums and galleries any more than the basic ability to read and write inevitably leads to literary greatness and published works of literature. But learning to draw was something I knew was valued by children and adults. Thus, my discovery led me in new directions, resulting in a 1989 revision of <i>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</i>, in which I focused on explaining my insight and proposing that individuals who had never been able to draw could learn to draw well very rapidly.<br><br>Subsequently, my colleagues and I developed a five-day workshop of forty hours of teaching and learning (eight hours a day for ?ve days), which proved to be surprisingly e?ective: students acquired quite high-level basic drawing skills in that brief time, and gained all the information they needed to go on making progress in drawing. Since drawing perceived subjects is always the same task, always requiring the ?ve basic component skills, they could proceed to any subject matter, learn to use any or all drawing mediums, and take the skill as far as they wished. They could also apply their new visual skills to thinking. The parallels to learning to read were becoming obvious.<br><br>Over the next decade, from 1989 to 1999, the connection of perceptual skills to general thinking, problem solving, and creativity became a more central focus for me, especially after publication of my 1986 book, <i>Drawing on the Artist Within</i>. In this<br><br>book, I proposed a &#x201c;written&#x201d; language for the right hemisphere: the language of line, the expressive language of art itself. This idea of using drawing to <i>aid thinking</i> proved to be quite useful in a class on creativity that I developed for university students and in small corporate seminars on problem solving.<br><br>Then, in 1999, I again revised <i>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</i>, again incorporating what we had learned over the years of teaching the ?ve basic skills and re?ning the lessons. I especially focused on the skill of sighting (proportion and perspective), which is perhaps the most di?cult component skill to teach in words, because of its complexity and its reliance on students&#x2019; acceptance of paradox, always anathema to the logical, concept-bound left brain. In addition, I urged using perceptual skills to &#x201c;see&#x201d; problems.<br><br>Now, with this third revision in 2012, I want to clarify to the best of my ability the global nature of drawing and to link drawing&#x2019;s basic component skills to thinking in general and to creativity in particular. Throughout many cultures, both in the United States and worldwide, there is much talk of creativity and our need for innovation and invention. There are many suggestions to try this or try that. But the nitty-gritty of precisely how to become more creative is seriously lacking. Our education system seems bent on eliminating every last bit of creative perceptual training of the right side of the brain, while overemphasizing the skills best accomplished by the left side of the brain: memorizing dates, data, theorems, and events with the goal of passing standardized tests. Today we are not only testing and grading our children into the ground, but we are not teaching them how to see and understand the <i>deep meaning</i> of what they learn, or to perceive the connectedness of information about the world. It is indeed time to try something di?erent.<br><br>Fortunately, the tide seems to be turning, according to a recent news report. A small group of cognitive scientists at the University of California at Los Angeles is recommending they call &#x201c;perceptual learning&#x201d; as a remedy to our failing educational practices. They express hope that such training will transfer to other contexts, and they have had some success with achieving transfer. Discouragingly, however, the news report ended: &#x201c;In an education awash with computerized learning tools and pilot programs of all kinds, the future of such perceptual learning e?orts is far from certain. Scientists still don&#x2019;t know the best way to train perceptual intuition, or which speci?c principles it&#x2019;s best suited for. And such tools, if they are incorporated into curriculums in any real way, will be subject to the judgment of teachers.&#x201d;<br><br>I would like to suggest that we already have a best way to train perceptual skills: it has been staring us in the face for decades, and we haven&#x2019;t (or wouldn&#x2019;t, or couldn&#x2019;t) accept it. I think it is not a coincidence that as drawing and creative arts in general have steadily diminished in school curricula since the mid-twentieth century, the educational achievement of students in the United States has likewise diminished, to the point that we now rank behind Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Sweden, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Slovenia.<br><br>In 1969, perceptual psychologist Rudolf Arnheim, one of the most widely read and respected scientists of the twentieth century, wrote:<br><br><i>&#x201c;The arts are neglected because they are based on perception, and perception is disdained because it is not assumed to involve thought. In fact, educators and administrators cannot justify giving the arts an important position in the curriculum unless they understand that the arts are the most powerful means of strengthening the perceptual component without which productive thinking is impossible in every ?eld </i> of academic study.<br><br><i>&#x201c;What is most needed is not more aesthetics or more esoteric manuals of art education but a convincing case made for visual thinking quite in general. Once we understand in theory, we might try to heal in practice the unwholesome split which cripples the training of reasoning power.&#x201d;</i><br><br>Drawing does indeed involve thought, and it is an e?ective and e?cient method for perceptual training. And perceptual knowledge can impact learning in all disciplines. We now know how to rapidly teach drawing. We know that learning to draw, like learning to read, is <i>not</i> dependent on something called &#x201c;talent,&#x201d; and that, given proper instruction, every person is able to learn the skill. Furthermore, given proper instruction, people can learn to <i>transfer</i> the basic perceptual components of drawing to other learning and to general thinking. And, as Michael Kimmelman said, learning to draw is a boon to happiness&#x2014;a panacea for the stultifying and uncreative drudgery of standardized testing that our schools have embraced.<br><br><b>Our two minds and modern multitasking</b><br><br>Today, as research expands and the information-processing styles and proclivities of the hemispheres become ever clearer, respected scientists are recognizing functional di?erences as evident and real, despite the fact that both hemispheres appear to be involved to a greater or lesser extent in every human activity. And there remains much uncertainty about the reason for the profound asymmetry of the human brain, which we seem to be aware of at the level of language. The expression &#x201c;I am of two minds about that&#x201d; clearly states our human situation. Our two minds, however, have not had an equal playing ?eld: until recently, language has dominated worldwide, especially in modern technological cultures like our own. Visual perception has been more or less taken for granted, with little requirement for special concern or education. Now, however, computer scientists who are trying to replicate human visual perception ?nd it extremely complicated and slow going. After decades of e?orts, scientists have ?nally achieved facial recognition by computers, but reading the meaning of changes in facial expression, accomplished instantly and e?ortlessly by the right hemisphere, will take much more time and work.<br><br>Meanwhile, visual images are everywhere, and visual and verbal information compete for attention. Constant multitasking linked to information overload is challenging the brain&#x2019;s ability to rapidly shift modes, or to simultaneously deal with both modes of input. The recent banning of texting while driving illustrates the problem of the brain&#x2019;s di?culty in simultaneously processing two modes of information. This recognition that we need to ?nd productive ways to use both modes perhaps explains why replicating right hemisphere processes is only now emerging as important and even, perhaps, critical.<br><br><b>A complication: the brain that studies itself</b><br><br>As a number of scientists have noted, research on the human brain is complicated by the fact that the brain is struggling to understand itself. This three-pound organ is perhaps the only bit of matter in the our universe&#x2014;at least as far as we know&#x2014;that observes and studies itself, wonders about itself, tries to analyze how it does what it does, and tries to maximize its capabilities. This paradoxical situation no doubt contributes to the deep mysteries that still remain despite rapidly expanding scienti?c knowledge. One of the most encouraging new discoveries that the human brain has made about itself is that it can physically change itself by changing its accustomed ways of thinking, by deliberately exposing itself to new ideas and routines, and by learning new skills. This discovery has led to a new category of neuroscientists, neuroplasticians, who use microelectrodes and brain scans to track complex brain maps of neuronal communication, and who have observed the brain revising its neuronal maps.<br><br><b>Brain plasticity: a new way to think about talent</b><br><br>This conception of a plastic brain, a brain that constantly changes with experience, that can reorganize and transmute and even develop new cells and new cell connections, is in direct contrast<br><br>to previous judgments ...</p><h2>The New Strong&#39;s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible</h2><p><p><strong>Find every word every time in this truly essential concordance.</strong></p><p>This truly is a one-of-a-kind concordance &#x2013; <em>The New Strong&#x2019;s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible</em>.

It's computer generated which gives you greater accuracy and the Strong numbering system links you <em>directly</em> to the original Greek and Hebrew words. This is a resource for serious Bible study and is essential for your library.</p></p><p><i>The New Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible</i> is nothing short of exhaustive. Weighing in at nearly six pounds, this research tool is the revised edition of the legendary classic that generations have come to depend on for biblical research. Nothing has been omitted from the original text published in 1890, but new supplementary material such as "The Laws of the Bible," "Teaching and Illustrations of Christ," and a "Harmony of the Gospels" has been added and existing material has been updated and improved. The "Topical Index" references thousands of verses relating to over 8,000 biblical subjects, names, places, things, concepts, events, and doctrines. In this main section of the concordance, scripture references are placed between a context line and the reference to either the Hebrew or Greek dictionary, making it easier to access all the features of the concordance at once. The most useful improvement is that variant spellings of proper names from modern versions have been cross-referenced. For instance, the person who uses the Revised Standard Version, the New International Version, or the New American Standard Version of the Bible can look up the modern word <i>Abronah</i>, which appears in these versions, and will be directed to <i>Ebronah</i>, the New King James spelling. A computer-generated typesetting, an obvious update from the first version, reads easily and provides design and format improvements. Any biblically based library would be incomplete without this indispensable edition. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>Dr. James Strong (1822-1894) was formerly president of Troy University and professor of exegetical theology at Drew Theological Seminary.</p><h2>Spaghetti in a Hot Dog Bun: Having the Courage To Be Who You Are</h2><p>Lucy is teased by a boy at school because she is different.

He has also created a second book series featuring D.W., Arthur&#39;s little sister, as well as numerous other books for children. Marc Brown lives with his family in Tisbury, Martha&#39;s Vineyard.PreSchool-Grade 2. Sure to be popular due to the success of the new PBS television series, these new additions to the series demonstrate the vocal talent of author/illustrator Marc Brown. Arthur's creator reads the texts, giving each character a distinctive voice. He is able to portray the females, like mother and D.W., while avoiding stereotypical high, squeaky voices. The production values on the recordings are excellent, with background music and helpful sound effects. The slamming of car doors, the sound of rain or footsteps, and other sound effects give the tapes the quality of old radio shows. Each tape opens with the theme song, "Say Hello to Arthur." Both sides of each tape are the same except for the page-turning signal bell on one side. In Arthur's Family Vacation, rain ruins the family's stay at the beach until Arthur thinks of activities they can do. In Arthur's Halloween, Arthur and D.W. learn you can't presume a house is haunted just because the outside looks run down. The artwork in each book features Brown's customary cartoon-like ink and watercolor illustrations that add humor to the stories. The tapes work well even without the books.<br><i>Penny Peck, San Leandro Public Library, CA</i><br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Everything Chocolate: A Decadent Collection of Morning Pastries, Nostalgic Sweets, and Showstopping Desserts</h2><p><b>Make your decadent dreams come true with this chocolate-covered collection of more than 180 foolproof recipes that showcase the treasured dessert ingredient--from delicious morning baked goods and pick-me-up treats to rich after-dinner delights for special occasions.</b><br><br>Chocolate may be the most universally loved (and craved) flavoring, and <i>Everything Chocolate</i> is the definitive guide to any sweet treat you can imagine featuring it, for any time of day.

When he led a 340-mile peaceful protest march through California, he ignited a cause and improved the lives of thousands of migrant farmworkers. But Cesar wasn't always a leader.

A native of Mexico, she now lives in San Francisco where she is pursuing a degree in creative writing and developing her career as an artist. She is also a puppet-maker and the host of a Spanish-language storytelling radio show.Grade 3-6-The dramatic story of Chavez's 340-mile march to protest the working conditions of migrant farmworkers in California is the centerpiece of this well-told biography. Readers meet Chavez at his grandparents' home in Arizona where he lived happily amid a large extended family. His childhood was cut short when, due to financial difficulties, the family was forced to move to California to seek employment. After years of laboring in the fields, Chavez became increasingly disturbed by the inhuman living conditions imposed by the growers. The historic 1965 strike against grape growers and the subsequent march for "La Causa" are vividly recounted, and Chavez's victory-the agreement by the growers granting the workers better conditions and higher pay-is palpable. While sufficient background information is provided to support the story and encourage further research, focusing on one event makes the story appealing to younger readers. The text is largely limited to one side of a spread; beautifully rendered earth-toned illustrations flow out from behind the words and onto the facing page.

Eager to learn more about this amazing animal, she writes a series of letters to her teacher, Mr. Blueberry, asking for information about whales and their habits. The humor of the situation lies in Mr. Blueberry's replies. He sends Emily some details, but he is also quite adamant that whatever is in her pond is not a whale since they live in salt water. Nevertheless, both Emily and readers know that indeed there is a whale in the pond, and the proof is the amusing, full-page watercolor cartoons. Emily shares her letters with the whale, who, after hearing about his species' migratory habits, leaves the pond to return to the ocean. (How he does this is not explained.) At first, Emily is saddened at her loss, but a chance meeting with Arthur on the beach gives her the opportunity to say goodbye.

Some, like <em>It's a Wonderful Life</em> and <em>A Christmas Story</em>, are perennials, while others, such as <em>Die Hard</em>, have only gradually become yuletide favorites. But they all have one thing in common: they use themes evoked by the holiday period - nostalgia, joy, togetherness, dysfunction, commercialism, or cynicism - as a force in their storytelling.<br><br><em>Turner Classic Movies: Christmas in the Movies </em>showcases the very best among this uniquely spirited strain of cinema.

The effects of the 1980s films <em>Beat Street</em>, <em>Wild Style</em>, and <em>StyleWars</em> are examined, as is the influence graffiti experts on today's subculture through books, magazines, and the Internet.</p> The practical elements of graffiti are considered in later chapters, which combine tips on handling a spray can, creating a unique tag, and getting work up safely and legally with step-by-step diagrams that show how to achieve effects such as bubblestyle, blockbusters, oneliners, and wildstyle.

He lives in Germany.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;This in-depth volume supplies readers with a lion's share of knowledge on the often-marginalized art form of graffiti. Ganter supplies a brief background of the art form, from its historical presence in ancient Pompeii through the modern-day hip-hop movement. After defining specific graffiti terminology, Ganter examines different methods and styles. The art descriptions are nicely supplemented with clear instructions along with visual examples. Ganter notably addresses the issue of legality by outlining the parameters of where readers can practice this art form without breaking any laws. The author uses general sketches in red and black ink for the first half of the book to portray the various graffiti designs. The latter portion relies upon full-on color to illustrate the different spraying styles. The book is at times somewhat technical, so those looking for a full art history of graffiti might wish to go elsewhere. Sample exercises for teachers to use in the classroom are also included. Consider purchasing for middle school and high school art classes, particularly in urban areas.&#x2014;Keith Klang, Port Washington Public Library, NY</p><h2>Pray through the Bible in a Year Journal: A Daily Devotional and Reading Plan</h2><p><b>Pray Your Way through the Bible--in 365 Days!</b><br><br> This beautiful deluxe journal features a plan for reading through the Bible in a year with an accompanying devotional prayer inspired by that day&#x2019;s scripture reading.&nbsp; Each entry encourages you to read a passage from the Old Testament, New Testament, Psalms, and Proverbs and provides plenty of journaling space for you to record your thoughts and prayers.&nbsp; It's a lovely way to keep track of a year spent in prayer and in God&#x2019;s Word!<br><br> &nbsp;<p>This lovely journal features:</p><ul><li>A beautiful, textured hardcover binding</li><li>Delightfully designed one-color interior</li><li>365 inspiring and encouraging devotional-like prayers</li><li>Daily Bible reading plan</li><li>Generous space to record personal thoughts and feelings</li></ul></p><p>This brand-new, deluxe journal features&nbsp;a plan for reading through the Bible in a year with an accompanying devotional prayer inspired by that day&#x2019;s scripture reading.

These things are in all of us I think, some vestige of our primitive past buried so deep in our genome as to be inseparable from what it is to be human. What we think of as civilization is a new experiment in the eyes of Father Time. Experts say that humans have been around for some fifty thousand years. We&#x2019;ve been carrying the bow for maybe five thousand (atlatls and spears before that), and pushing the plow for maybe two thousand. We have been hunters forever. We are built to run, to pursue big game on the open savannas, to kill and eat them. With the dwindling of the Pleistocene mega fauna, mammoths and such, the bow became more important and indeed helped to make us who we are today. It still holds that attraction, same as the hearth. When I was a kid I would make crude bows from green plum branches, big at one end and small at the other. A discarded hay string would serve as a bowstring. My arrows were fat and unfletched and would scarcely fly more than a few yards, usually tumbling over in midair. The small creatures around our home were plenty safe. When I was about 12 or so my brother brought me two old Ben Person recurves he&#x2019;d found at a yard sale. One was a short bow, probably no more than 48 inches and the other was more of a standard size. They both drew about 50 lbs if I recall. That fall happened to be a good year for cottontails around our little farm and I spent countless hours walking the fields and shooting at them as they busted from underfoot. Although I&#x2019;d get several shots a day I never did hit one on the fly but I remember that fall fondly nonetheless. The pleasure of jumping rabbits and seeing the feathered shaft streaking toward them was a thrill I&#x2019;ve never forgotten. I made my first &#x201c;real&#x201d; bow when I was in high school, after getting a copy of the Traditional Bowyers Bible in the mail (more on this in a moment). My first bow, a decrowned mulberry flatbow, broke within about 10 shots. The second held together quite well and is probably still around somewhere and capable of shooting an arrow, though it would probably draw about 70lbs. When I first started making bows I used the woods I had close at hand; mulberry, common persimmon, red maple, white cedar, etc. I&#x2019;d probably made more than a dozen bows of various woods before I ever saw a piece of Osage. People often ask me where they can find a bow stave and, invariably, I tell them to use what they have close by. No matter where you live, you&#x2019;ll have something near that will make a bow. Go cut it down and get started. This book is an attempt to share some of what I&#x2019;ve learned over my years of bow making. The Traditional Bowyers Bible series, as mentioned earlier, is still a great source of information. Why write another book on making wood bows you might ask? The simple answer is that there are so many ways of doing and explaining things. There are still unanswered questions and we&#x2019;ll cover many of them here. We will cover all of the most frequently asked questions, and lay out a simple plan that should guide you through the entire process, from finding a stave to stringing your bow and shooting your first arrow. Some of what you&#x2019;ll find here, you&#x2019;ll find nowhere else.</p><p></p><h2>BibleProject Poster Collection Book</h2><p>A multi-use book that contains the entire collection of every diagram in the Read Scripture series.

The goal is to provide better support and care practices when someone is living with an ever-changing condition.

As an occupational therapist with forty years of clinical practice, she has founded a company and an approach to support and engage people experiencing changes in brain function. This Positive Approach� to Care emphasizes making use of the skills retained while providing support, and substituting our skill, for what is no longer available. This belief led to Teepa creating the GEMS� States model for brain change. The GEMS model compares people to gemstones and focuses on retained abilities in order for us to see what is beautiful, and still available, for the person with whom we share time and offer support and care. Teepa currently holds clincial appointments att Duke University School of Nursing and the University of Northa Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine.</p><h2>Winter Cottage</h2><p><p><b>An Amazon Charts bestseller.</b></p><p><b>A gripping novel about family secrets...and coming home for the first time.</b></p><p>Still grieving the loss of her wandering, free-spirited mother, Lucy Kincaid leaves Nashville for the faded town of Cape Hudson, Virginia.

In this volume, you'll find a collection of low floor, high ceiling tasks that will help you do just that, by looking at the big ideas at the eighth-grade level through visualization, play, and investigation.</p> <p>During their work with tens of thousands of teachers, authors Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, and Cathy Williams heard the same message&#x2014;that they want to incorporate more brain science into their math instruction, but they need guidance in the techniques that work best to get across the concepts they needed to teach. So the authors designed <i>Mindset Mathematics</i> around the principle of active student engagement, with tasks that reflect the latest brain science on learning. Open, creative, and visual math tasks have been shown to improve student test scores, and more importantly change their relationship with mathematics and start believing in their own potential. The tasks in <i>Mindset Mathematics</i> reflect the lessons from brain science that:</p> <ul> <li>There is no such thing as a math person - anyone can learn mathematics to high levels.</li> <li>Mistakes, struggle and challenge are the most important times for brain growth.</li> <li>Speed is unimportant in mathematics.</li> <li>Mathematics is a visual and beautiful subject, and our brains want to think visually about mathematics.</li> </ul> <p>With engaging questions, open-ended tasks, and four-color visuals that will help kids get excited about mathematics, <i>Mindset Mathematics</i> is organized around nine big ideas which emphasize the connections within the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and can be used with any current curriculum.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Last Musketeer #3: Double Cross</h2><p><p><strong>The past, present, and future are all at stake in this final book in the thrilling time travel adventure trilogy from <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Stuart Gibbs.

They still sit around like a bunch of old geezers, swapping tales of epic storms, monstrous beasts and grisly battles. Talk to any gamer in his twenties and at some point he&#x2019;ll say it: &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too young to get it. You never saw Other�world.&#x201d;<br><br>Now keep in mind, most of these idiots never experienced the original Other�world either. Even at the height of its popularity, it never had more than a handful of subscribers. It wasn&#x2019;t until years after the publisher pulled the plug that it became known in geek lore as the greatest game of all time.<br><br>I always thought that was bullshit. I don&#x2019;t anymore.<br><br>It took a twenty��something tech billionaire named Milo Yolkin to drag the game back from the dead. Today at noon, his company released an early-�access version of Other�world 2.0. Two thousand lucky gamers were chosen to test it, and somehow I&#x2019;m one of them. The original Other�world players were all dorks like me, but as far as I can tell, this new group of players has little in common aside from deep pockets. The app itself is free&#x2014;�you just have to buy the exclusive new headset that goes with the game. Only a couple thousand have been made, and each one costs over two grand.<br><br>I have no clue what the old Other�world looked like on a PC monitor when it came out over a decade ago. But I gotta admit&#x2014;�when I downloaded the new app and I put on the headset, I wasn&#x2019;t expecting graphics this good. I know everything is CGI, but my eyes are completely convinced that it&#x2019;s real. I&#x2019;ve got a plastic brick strapped to my face, there&#x2019;s sweat trickling out of my haptic gloves, and I&#x2019;d rather die than be seen in the dainty booties I&#x2019;m wearing. Back in the real world, my body is blind, deaf and helpless. I&#x2019;ve been in Other�world for over seventeen hours now, and there is no way in hell that I&#x2019;m leaving.<br><br>Of course, this world has been trying to kill me from the very first second I set out to explore. I&#x2019;ve encountered some truly insane shit so far&#x2014;�an avalanche, lighting strikes, quicksand and some kind of mutated polar bear that I managed to butcher and eat using nothing but a dagger and my two bare hands. Still, nothing compares to what I&#x2019;ve just found.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve come to a stone path that disappears into a cavern carved out of a glacier. I run my hand along one of the icy walls. I feel that it&#x2019;s there, but my fingertips can neither confirm nor deny that the surface is as smooth or as cold as it appears. I shouldn&#x2019;t have cheaped out when I bought the gloves, but the best ones were so expensive that they&#x2019;d have triggered a credit alert. I&#x2019;m sure I could have found a way around it if I&#x2019;d known the fancy gloves would be worth it. But none of the rumors prepared me for Other�world.<br><br>When I look up, I see a sun just like the one I&#x2019;ve always known burning in the sky. Its light penetrates the ice around me, and the whole glacier glows like an enchanted gem. I can hear water rushing somewhere deep within the glacier. A sharp crack echoes behind me, and I spin around a little too quickly. My stomach drops and hot vomit rises and scalds the back of my throat. They haven&#x2019;t found a way to truly beat the motion sickness yet. I close my eyes, swallow and wait until the dizziness fades.<br><br>Then I take a deep breath and open my eyes again. Stretching out toward the horizon is the empty ice field I just crossed. Somewhere in the distance is the City of Imra, where I began my journey. Apparently that&#x2019;s where all Other�world adventures begin. You design your avatar and walk through a door and suddenly you&#x2019;re outside Imra&#x2019;s gates. In the few minutes I was there, I watched a parade of avatars pass through them.<br><br>They&#x2019;re all still back there, I guess. They say the original Other�world could get pretty smutty, but I don&#x2019;t think it had anything quite like Imra. Apparently the city&#x2019;s a CGI Sodom that makes Grand Theft Auto look like Dora the Explorer. I was tempted to do a little sightseeing in town, but that seemed to be what the designers expected us to do. So I set off in the opposite direction. Away from the city. Down a mountainside. Into the wilderness. Across the ice fields. The way I figure it, when you&#x2019;re given a chance to explore the most incredible survival sandbox ever created, you shouldn&#x2019;t let yourself get slowed down by a few anatomically correct non-�player characters.<br><br>Now I&#x2019;m standing here in front of the ice cave, with the wind whistling all around me. It&#x2019;s a pity I can&#x2019;t feel anything but the steady chill of central air. If I breathe in too deeply, I can smell the Febreze my mom&#x2019;s cleaning lady uses. But my eyes are burning from snow glare, and my toes are numb. Before I enter the glacier, I turn one last time and scan the frozen white landscape behind me. There are no signs of movement, but I know I&#x2019;m not on my own. Someone&#x2019;s followed me here. She&#x2019;s always kicked ass at camouflage, and I haven&#x2019;t caught sight of her. But I don&#x2019;t need my eyes to tell me that Kat&#x2019;s in Other�world too. I feel her presence&#x2014;�and I&#x2019;m finding it hard to wipe the shit-�eating grin off my face.<br><br>Back in the real world, Kat hasn&#x2019;t spoken to me in months. I&#x2019;ve tried pretty much everything, and Other�world was my last resort. On Friday I left a set of gear in her locker, along with a note to let her know I&#x2019;d be logging on at noon today. I didn&#x2019;t think she could resist being one of the first to see Milo Yolkin&#x2019;s new wonderland. So I was pretty bummed when I didn&#x2019;t catch sight of her outside Imra. It&#x2019;s starting to look like my investment paid off, though. As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, a few thousand dollars of my mother&#x2019;s money is a small price to pay for the pleasure of Kat&#x2019;s company.<br><br>I step forward into the cave and stop. Lurking in a shadow is a figure I didn&#x2019;t see until now. Someone or something is guarding the entrance. I draw my dagger and prepare to strike. Everything around me may be fake, but the sound of my heart pounding is real. As my eyes adjust, I see a thin man dressed in what looks like a modern-�day suit. He&#x2019;s about a foot taller than I am, and there&#x2019;s a scarf wrapped Bedouin-�style around his head. The thin strip of face left uncovered is ebony black. In one hand the man holds a gnarled staff. An amulet hangs around his neck, a clear stone in its center. When the man doesn&#x2019;t move, I have a go at stealing his staff, but his grip remains firm. It&#x2019;s only when I try to take the amulet that I realize I&#x2019;m attempting to mug a statue. I rap my knuckles against its hollow chest. It seems to be sculpted from clay.<br><br>I suppose the clay man is a sign that I&#x2019;m on the right track. Open world or not, the developers wouldn&#x2019;t have placed a statue here for no reason. There&#x2019;s bound to be something interesting at the end of the path. And when I find it, I have a hunch that the statue will spring to life and show me what it can do with its staff. But why worry about that right now, when I can listen to the crunch of rocks beneath my bootie-�clad feet? Or watch chunks of ice bobbing in the Slurpee-blue stream that&#x2019;s flowing beside the path? The scenery alone is worth every single penny of the six grand I charged to my mom&#x2019;s credit card.<br><br>I plunge deeper into the glacier, occasionally sneaking a peek over my shoulder, hoping to catch Kat slinking up behind me. I&#x2019;m thinking about the two of us alone together in an icy blue cavern with a giant clay man guarding the door. It&#x2019;s been over a year since she and I have been by ourselves. I&#x2019;m enjoying the thought so much that when I turn a corner and see him, I almost mistake him for a rock.<br><br>He sits on a throne chiseled out of granite. His body is made of a gray material that looks like stone, and there&#x2019;s an impressive set of horns sprouting out of his head. He&#x2019;s human in shape, though he seems to be built on a much larger scale. Whoever he is, he feels no need for clothes. Heat radiates from him, and the melting ice walls form a sphere around his body. The moat of meltwater at his feet is clear, but I can&#x2019;t gauge its depth. On the opposite side of his chamber is a tall metal door that doesn&#x2019;t really fit with the decorating scheme. I&#x2019;m itching to find out what&#x2019;s behind it, but it&#x2019;s pretty obvious that I&#x2019;ll need to make it past the big dude first.<br><br>I make my way closer, and his head rises. I can&#x2019;t tell if he sees me, because he doesn&#x2019;t have a face, but I get the sense that he&#x2019;s not very happy. From what I&#x2019;ve read online, the lands of Other�world are ruled by demigods known as Elementals. This might be one of them. Some Elementals are helpful; many are hostile. I&#x2019;m guessing the creature in front of me isn&#x2019;t interested in making friends.<br><br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t expecting visitors.&#x201d; His voice booms in my headset and I have to turn the volume down.<br><br>Other�world&#x2019;s new publisher has spent months bragging about its next-�generation AI, but there&#x2019;s something that makes me think this guy&#x2019;s not part of the game. And if he&#x2019;s not an Elemental or an NPC, then I&#x2019;m not the only explorer around. Whoever this is, he&#x2019;s built a formidable avatar.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess not,&#x201d; I say into my mike. &#x201c;Looks like you forgot to get dressed. You know, a stud like you would be pretty popular back in Imra. I&#x2019;ve heard the place is a nonstop orgy. What are you doing out here when the action&#x2019;s back there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I could ask the same of you,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, well, I&#x2019;m allergic to fun. And mangos. Long-�haired cats, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How amusing,&#x201d; he says, giving my avatar the once-�over. &#x201c;You could have been anyone. And this is what you chose? What are you&#x2014;�a peasant?&#x201d; He sounds so . . . disappointed. &#x201c;Lack of imagination is a terrible affliction.&#x201d;<br><br>I glance down at my dull brown robe, sewn from the best cyberburlap available. Whenever I&#x2019;m given the option, I choose something similar.<br><br>&#x201c;I can think of worse,&#x201d; I tell him. &#x201c;Nothing wrong with keeping things simple. You know what they say: the flashier the avatar, the smaller the . . .&#x201d; I stop the instant he stands up. His crotch is nothing but a smooth bump. He&#x2019;s like one of the action figures I used to torture when I was a kid. &#x201c;You know, you&#x2019;re missing a little something down below.&#x201d; I gesture to his absent parts. &#x201c;They had some amazing options during setup. Might be worth a reset.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I appreciate your concern, but I have everything I need,&#x201d; he responds, moving toward me. &#x201c;The ice fields are no place for guests. I&#x2019;m afraid you must leave and return to the City of Imra.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Make me.&#x201d; It just pops out. Which happens more often than I&#x2019;d like. My tongue produces words faster than my brain can approve them.<br><br>&#x201c;Make you?&#x201d; he responds incredulously. &#x201c;Perhaps you&#x2019;re not aware that Other�world is intended for players eighteen and older? Did you lie when you registered?&#x201d;<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t, but what the hell does he care?<br><br>&#x201c;Spare me the lecture and get ready to rumble,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been battling the environment for seventeen hours straight, and it&#x2019;s time for bed. I need a little PVP action to put me to sleep.&#x201d;<br><br>The avatar approaches, and soon he&#x2019;s towering over me. Once again, I&#x2019;m blown away by the details. I can actually see veins throbbing in his chest, and though I&#x2019;m an eighteen-�year-�old hetero�sexual, even I recognize that the dude&#x2019;s nipples are works of art. &#x201c;You assume Other�world is like the games you know. I assure you it&#x2019;s not. You&#x2019;ve entered my sanctuary, and you are not welcome.&#x201d; The guy&#x2019;s beginning to glow from within like an ember. As his head lights up, features finally appear on his face, and I almost bolt. He does not look friendly.<br><br>Instead of running, I draw my dagger. &#x201c;Then you&#x2019;d better kick me out.&#x201d;<br><br>Before I can make a move, three flaming arrows zip past my shoulder. They miss the monstrous avatar and sink into the frozen arched ceiling above him. A second later, an explosion rocks the entire cavern. I steady myself and watch as ice rains down from above, burying the beast. I turn to find a sleek figure behind me. She&#x2019;s dressed in a body-�hugging suit of reflective material. It&#x2019;s hard to see her even though she&#x2019;s standing out in the open, but I&#x2019;d know the face anywhere.<br><br>&#x201c;You provoked that guy on purpose, Simon,&#x201d; Kat says. The voice is all hers, and it sets me on fire. &#x201c;Did you think you had any chance of winning a fight with that dinky little dagger?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely not. I figured you&#x2019;d show up and save me,&#x201d; I tell her. &#x201c;I wanted to see what you&#x2019;re wearing. Very nice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go, dumbass,&#x201d; she orders. She&#x2019;s never been able to accept a compliment. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be out of there soon.&#x201d;<br><br>I glance back. The mysterious door behind the avatar is blocked now, so there&#x2019;s no real reason to stay. Kat is already retreating down the path, and I race to catch up, following her toward the entrance of the cavern.

There&#x2019;s no place to run. A geyser of lava erupts from beneath the ice and showers down on us. My crappy haptic gloves and booties are suddenly so hot that I yank them off and throw them across my bedroom. I keep the headset on, hoping for one last vision of Kat.

Among the titles are <em>Peter&#x2019;s Dream</em>, <em>I Don&#x2019;t Like Peas</em>, and <em>The New Bike</em> (the latter two published under the pen name Marie Vinje), the <em>Get Ready for Preschool</em>, <em>Kindergarten</em>, and<em> First Grade </em>workbook trio, along with the entire Get Ready, Little Thinker, I Know It!, Try-n-Spy, and Little Busy Book workbook series.</p> <p>She is also co-founder, along with her late husband James Hoffman, Ph.D., of School Zone Publishing. Visionary in business, she has long looked at the world through a child&#x2019;s eyes, infusing her stories and lessons with joy and relatability.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a mother of 4 back in the &#x2018;70s, like moms the world over throughout history, she wanted what was best for her children. And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents. Her husband lent his blended talents of educator and entrepreneur. A professor of education who also had first-hand experience as an elementary teacher, he was involved in teacher education programs at several colleges and had served at the helm of a company that published classroom materials.</p> <p>Combining rock-solid editorial judgment and creative instincts with a thorough understanding of early education, Joan Hoffman was an exemplary proponent of design thinking long before it became a conceptual label.

With the next generation&#x2014;both son Jonathan and daughter Jennifer&#x2014;taking on creative and strategic leadership roles in the company their parents started, School Zone seamlessly integrated digital learning platforms. The company received Apple&#x2019;s exclusive Human Interface Design Excellence Award for software development, and its apps were part of the first-generation iPad launch in 2010. School Zone&#x2019;s flagship product, the Little Scholar Learning Tablet, has earned industry-wide recognition and awards, as has its online learning destination Anywhere Teacher. Inspired by mom&#x2019;s story-telling excellence, son Jonathan continued that legacy with Charlie &amp; Company, an original series for ages 3-7, available on Oznnoz, Kidoodle.tv, ToonGoggles, BatteryPop, Ameba, and Highbrow.</p> <p>Joan Hoffman says, &#x201c;It is incredibly rewarding to see the children and grandchildren of some of our original customers enjoying our ever-evolving books, apps, flash cards, games, music, and other products&#x2014;both print and digital.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> In 2019 School Zone celebrates its 40th anniversary, spanning portions of five decades and having sold more than 370 million educational products.

We also trace the paths with our fingers. She mostly likes scribbling at this point but she will get it since this book will last a long time. --School Zone Website<br><br>My daughter has been working on tracing more at daycare in the preschool room, and she was getting really good at it, but I wanted her to keep practicing. I bought this book hoping she'd use it a few times, and she uses it several times a week! She absolutely loves tracing in it. I think it's having special markers for it, and the different activities. One thing to note: be sure to wipe it off right away when you're done with it, as it gets really hard to remove once it's been sitting for a day or so. Still comes off by using cleaner, but just takes more effort. Also, it doesn't come with markers, so make sure to pick some of those up too! --Amazon<br><br>I got this book last week, and already my 3 year old daughter has improved greatly! She draws straight lines and beautiful circles now, all because of the dry erase, trace-the-dashed-lines features in the book. She absolutely loves using her book. She will color, trace, draw, erase, and repeat for hours...which is saying a lot because her attention span is not usually that great! The pictures are cute and engaging as well.

Does that sound like a wacky idea? Many at the time thought so. Borglum faced a lot of opposition and problems at every turn; the blasting and carving carried out through the years of the Great Depression when funding for anything was hard to come by. Yet Mount Rushmore now draws almost three million visitors to the Black Hills every year. This is an entertaining chronicle of one man&#39;s magnificent obsession, which even today sparks controversy.</p><p>True Kelley is the author-illustrator of <i>Who Was Pablo Picasso? </i>and the author of <i>Who Is Dolly Parton?</i>, <i>Who Was Abigail Adams?</i>, and <i>Who Was Roald Dahl?</i><p><b>Where Is Mount Rushmore?</b></p><p>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1924, the world-famous sculptor Gutzon Borglum and his thirteen-year-old son took a trip together out west. They left their home in Connecticut and, days later, got off a train in Rapid City, South Dakota. Only about six thousand people lived in Rapid City. South Dakota had been a state for only thirty-five years. The Borglums felt they were in the middle of nowhere. They actually were smack-dab in the center of the United States.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Gutzon had come to South Dakota to see if he could find a mountain to carve into the biggest sculpture in the country. He was a patriotic man, and his idea was to give America a sculpture to glorify its greatness. Perhaps it could be huge carvings of great Americans with heads as high as the tallest buildings. What an amazing idea! But many people thought it was crazy. And no one, not even Borglum himself, realized how hard it would be to do.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gutzon and his son, Lincoln, traveled about twenty-five miles southwest of Rapid City to nearby Keystone, a mining town farther into the backwoods. From there, a South Dakota state forester led them on horseback, following logging trails into the wild country of the Black Hills.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Black Hills is an area 120 miles long and sixty miles wide. It rises up four thousand feet and more. It is like an island in the middle of the treeless prairie. From the rolling grasslands, the dark green ponderosa pine trees on the hills look black. With steep slopes, deep canyons, rocky ledges, and clear streams, it is rugged but very beautiful country. It is home to many animals, like elk, rattlesnakes, bison, prairie dogs, mountain lions, mountain goats, frogs, birds, and fish. There are medicinal and edible plants, wild raspberries, and flowers. It&#x2019;s no wonder the Lakota Sioux called it sacred land.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Borglum party clambered up steep, craggy slopes to the top of the tallest mountain, Harney Peak. All around was a wonderful view. Far away, Gutzon could see a granite mountain. It stood higher than the surrounding peaks. That would be the place for his giant sculpture!&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The name of the mountain was Mount Rushmore.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today, huge six-story-high carved heads of presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln gaze out from high on the granite face of Mount Rushmore. Borglum overcame an incredible number of obstacles to create this great national monument. He said it was like waging a one-man war. With his combined drive and talent, he was probably the only man of his time who could have succeeded. For many reasons, it would be impossible to do such a project today.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mount Rushmore is a major tourist attraction for South Dakota. It has become a symbol of patriotism and pride for many Americans. But people from all over the world travel to marvel at it. Even so, there are people who think it should not ever have been made.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1: The Black Hills</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Throughout history the Black Hills, rising dramatically from the Great Plains, have impressed all who&#x2019;ve seen them. They are called hills, but they are the highest mountains east of the Rockies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and west of the Alps! Harney Peak, at 7,242 feet, is the tallest.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Black Hills are some of the oldest hills in North America: sixty million years old. French trappers named them <i>C�tes Noires</i>; that means Black Sides. The Lakota Sioux called them <i>Paha Sapa</i>&#x2014;the sacred mountains and place of spirits.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> How did these hills get plopped in the middle of the plains around them?<br> &nbsp;<br> More than two billion years ago, there were only layers of sand, clay, and gravel deep beneath an ancient sea. Over many years, they turned into sedimentary&#x2014;or layered&#x2014;rock. Heat and pressure changed it into a type of rock called <i>mica schist</i>. Then, 1.5 billion years ago, hot liquid rock oozed from below and joined with the mica to make granite. Sediment piled on top of that.<br> &nbsp;<br> Seventy million years ago, at the time of the dinosaurs, the molten granite rock was still below the surface of the earth. Over thousands of years, the rock cooled and rose up. The Black Hills were born. As the sea dried, wind, ice, and rain wore away the sediment on top of the granite core. Beautiful stone towers like the Needles emerged.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Gutzon Borglum knew the granite of these hills was great for sculpting. There were pockets of schist material inside the rock that were not so good, however. The schist could cause some trouble for a sculptor. Also embedded in the rock in parts of the Black Hills were precious metals like silver, tin, and gold.<br> &nbsp;<br> At 6,040 feet, Mount Rushmore is taller than the mountains around it. The Lakota Sioux called it &#x201c;Six Grandfathers.&#x201d; Later, settlers named it Cougar Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain, Slaughterhouse Mountain, and Keystone Cliffs.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the end, it came to be named for a New York lawyer, Charles E. Rushmore. How strange! Charles was on business for a tin company in the Black Hills. In 1885 he was staying in a log cabin in the hills. He asked his guide what the mountain was called. The guide answered that he didn&#x2019;t know, so it must be Mount Rushmore! It was a joke! But the name stuck.&nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Poland: A Novel</h2><p>In this sweeping novel, James A. Michener chronicles eight tumultuous centuries as three Polish families live out their destinies. The Counts Lubonski, the petty nobles Bukowksi, and the peasants Buk are at some times fiercely united, at others tragically divided. With an inspiring tradition of resistance to brutal invaders, from the barbarians to the Nazis, and a heritage of pride that burns through eras of romantic passion and courageous solidarity, their common story reaches a breathtaking culmination in the historic showdown between the ruthless Communists and rebellious farmers of the modern age.

Michener</b> was one of the world&#x2019;s most popular writers, the author of more than forty books of fiction and nonfiction, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Tales of the South Pacific, </i>the bestselling novels <i>The Source, Hawaii, Alaska, Chesapeake, Centennial, Texas, Caribbean, </i>and <i>Caravans, </i>and the memoir <i>The World Is My Home</i>. Michener served on the advisory council to NASA and the International Broadcast Board, which oversees the Voice of America. Among dozens of awards and honors, he received America&#x2019;s highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1977, and an award from the President&#x2019;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities in 1983 for his commitment to art in America. Michener died in 1997 at the age of ninety.In a small Polish farm community, during the fall planting season of 1981, events occurred which electrified the world, sending reverberations of magnitude to capitals as diverse as Washington, Peking and especially Moscow.<br> &nbsp;<br> This village of Bukowo, 763 souls, stood at the spot where the great river Vistula turns to the north in its stately passage from its birthplace in the Carpathian Mountains at the south to its destiny in the Baltic Sea at the north. In the little settlement there was a stone castle erected in A.D. 914 as a guard against marauders from the east, but this had been destroyed in the early years when those marauders arrived in stupefying force. Each subsequent owner of the village had planned at one time or other either to tear down the ruins or rebuild them, but none had done so because the old castle exercised a spell on all who saw it, and there was a legend among the villagers that so long as their ruined tower stood, they would stand. There must have been some truth to this because there had often been great clamor in Bukowo, but like its doomed tower, it still stood.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nearly thirty-six million Poles, of whom eighteen million were of voting age, were controlled by the Communist party of only three million members. This minority had made a symbolic concession right at the start of the present trouble. They agreed to hold the discussions over farm policy in the very village from which the principal protester came, and this was interpreted by all as a sincere gesture of good will, but as Janko Buk, the leader they were trying to placate, said: &#x201c;With the steel strikers giving them so much trouble in Gdansk, they can&#x2019;t afford to have us on their backs, too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Communists had chosen this village for several additional reasons. It lay in the heart of a large agricultural district and was thus representative. It was also well removed from any big city whose practiced agitators might try to influence or even disrupt proceedings. And perhaps most important, it was near the recently renovated Bukowski palace, with its seventy rooms available for meetings of whatever size might be required.<br> &nbsp;<br> The three names&#x2014;Buk for the peasant leader of the troubles, Bukowo for his village, and Bukowski for the family which had once owned the palace&#x2014;obviously stemmed from the same root, the strong word buk signifying beech tree, and this was appropriate because from time past remembering, the vast area east of the river had contained a large forest whose principal trees had been oaks, pines, ash, maples and especially beech, those tall, heavy trees with excellent trunks. Through the centuries foresters had selectively cut these trees, sometimes floating the great trunks all the way to the Baltic for shipment to Hamburg and Antwerp, but all the woodsmen had carefully tended a particularly noble stand of beech that defined the eastern edge of the village. Like the castle which they resembled, the beeches of Bukowo possessed a special grace.<br> &nbsp;<br> The great forest of which they formed such a major part had not borne a name until A.D. 888, when the extremely primitive people who lived between it and the river were frightened by a semi-madman who lived amongst them. He claimed that one evening while returning home with a bundle of faggots collected from under the beech trees, he had been accosted by the devil, who wore about his neck long chains which clinked and clanged, and he convinced them, especially the children, that if they listened closely when the devil was afoot, they could hear the rattling chains.<br> &nbsp;<br> The dense woods was named the Forest of Szczek in that long-ago year, and everyone agreed that the name was well chosen, for clinking, clanging sounds did often come from this forest, and since in Polish the letter e&#x2014;if printed with an accent, &#x119;&#x2014;carries an n sound, the word was pronounced shtchenk, which resembles the sound that a chain clinking would make.<br> &nbsp;<br> The villagers protected the ruins of their good-luck castle and tended the beech trees they loved, but they were proudest of their palace. It had been assembled in rambling style over many centuries by the poor Bukowskis, who had been little better than peasants themselves although acknowledged as petty nobles, and in grand style by the Bukowskis of 1896, who had stumbled upon a fortune.<br> &nbsp;<br> The palace stood on a slight rise overlooking the castle ruins and the Vistula beyond and was a place of real magnificence, the equal of the lesser French ch�teaux along the Loire. Shaped like a two-story capital U, the open part with its two protruding wings facing west, its long major base faced east, overlooking the village and the forest beyond. It had been heavily damaged in the closing days of World War II during the German defeat and the Russian victory, but its many rooms had been rebuilt in the 1950s and now functioned as a museum, a rest home for Communist party VIPs and a meeting place for major convocations. A good chauffeur could drive from Warsaw in something under four hours and from Krakow in less than three, so that when government officials selected Bukowo as the site for this important conference they knew what they were doing. Anyone who had visited the Bukowski palace once wanted to do so again.<br> &nbsp;<br> A major charm of the setting was the village which perched at the edge of the forest. Even before the rude castle had been built or the forest named, a few hovels had collected here, and in the more than a thousand years which had followed, the number had constantly but slowly increased, with the addition of one or two new cottages every fifty years. Improvements came slowly, for the petty nobles who occupied the more permanent buildings that would evolve into the palace cared little about what happened to their peasants. Over a space of eight hundred years no cottage in Bukowo had other than a dirt floor. For nine hundred years none had a chimney, none had windows, and some cottages had passed a hundred years without acquiring a permanent door.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet improvements did slowly filter in, a wooden roof to replace a thatch, a slab of precious glass for a rude window, so that in time an attractive collection of harmonious, low, modestly colored cottages grouped themselves artistically about the three sides of a trim central rectangle. As with the palace, the open end faced the Vistula, with the backs of the cottages abutting against the grove of beech trees. Peasants who were born and raised in Bukowo preferred it to any other villages they knew, but this was a limited endorsement because many would have had an opportunity to see only those few that were within a dozen miles. Beyond that perimeter the villagers rarely moved.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was Bukowo: primeval forest to the east, a splendid grove of beech trees, a snug village, a handsome palace, ancient castle ruins and, dominating everything, the majesty of the Vistula. Here was where the most advanced theories of the contemporary world would do battle.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sessions would be held in one of the many medium-sized rooms on the upper floor of the palace, and there were six widely recognized clues by which those attending would be able to determine the importance of their meeting. In Communist Poland if guests invited to a formal discussion were of trivial position, only tea was served, in plain cups and from a plain pot. Guests slightly more important saw with gratification that the teacups were placed on a lace doily. Those of medium power sometimes gasped with pleasure when bottles of a delicious black-currant cordial called sok (juice) were to be provided, but one did not wield real power until the fourth level was reached: all the preceding plus a bottle of really good brandy.<br> &nbsp;<br> If the visitors held truly high office, a plate of cookies would be added, delicious things wafer-thin and decorated with sugared designs, but if the official being honored held a cabinet position, or comparable rank in the army or church, or if he was a cinema star or a leading editor, a sixth mark of honor could be reached. In addition to the five customary degrees&#x2014;tea to cookies&#x2014;a final one appeared: actual sandwiches, made of the best bread, with thick butter and tangy cheese, or ham, or spiced chicken. Persons attending a meeting where all this was offered did not require medieval trumpets or modern cannon salutes; they knew they came with honors.<br> &nbsp;<br> For the meeting of the agricultural consultants, sandwiches were prepared and a chocolate cake.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Communist representatives reached the palace first, and custodians showed them to their rooms; with so many to choose from, it was easy to get one overlooking the castle to the south and the river to the west. Clerks and research assistants received rooms looking toward the beech trees, and some deemed these preferable, for the Forest of Szczek was in its own way as beautiful as the river.<br> &nbsp;<br> The arrival of the cabinet minister occasioned a good deal of merriment, for his name was Szymon Bukowski, and everyone joked: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to be in your palace,&#x201d; and he had fun explaining that the Bukowskis who had owned this showplace were not from his Bukowskis, but nevertheless everyone kept calling it his palace.</p><h2>Ella Bella Ballerina and Cinderella: A Ballerina book for Toddlers and Girls 4-8 (Christmas, Easter, and birthday gifts!)

Peter Rabbit&#39;s cousin, Benjamin Bunny, has been a very popular character since this book&#39;s first publication in 1904. In this tale we hear all about his and Peter&#39;s adventures in Mr McGregor&#39;s vegetable garden, and what happens to them when they meet a cat! Even more frightening, is what happens to the two pesky bunnies when Old Mr Benjamin Bunny finds out what they have been up to! Beatrix Potter is regarded as one of the world&#39;s best-loved children&#39;s authors of all time. From her first book, The Tale of Peter Rabbit, published by Frederick Warne in 1902, she went on to create a series of stories based around animal characters including Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, Benjamin Bunny, Jemima Puddle-duck, Mr. Jeremy Fisher and Tom Kitten. Her humorous, lively tales and beautiful illustrations have become a natural part of childhood. With revenue from the sales of her books, Beatrix Potter bought a farm - Hill Top - in the English Lake District, where she later became a farmer and prize-winning sheep breeder. She launched the now vast merchandise programme by patenting the very first Peter Rabbit doll in 1903. The product range continues to grow today with licences around the world including baby clothing and bedding, nursery decor products and collectables. Upon her death, Beatrix Potter left 14 farms and over 4000 acres of Lake District farmland to the National Trust so that the place that she loved would remain undeveloped and protected for future generations to enjoy. Today Beatrix Potter&#39;s original 23 tales are still published by Frederick Warne, alongside a wide range of other formats including baby books, activity books and gift and sound books. The Tale of Benjamin Bunny is number four in Beatrix Potter&#39;s series of 23 little books.

It explores 30 directors&#x2019; love of a film they saw at a particularly formative moment, how it influenced their own works, and how it made them think differently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Rebel Without a Cause</i> inspired John Woo to comb his hair and talk like James Dean. For Richard Linklater, &#x201c;something was simmering in me, but <i>Raging Bull</i> brought it to a boil.&#x201d; <i>Apocalypse Now</i> inspired Danny Boyle to make larger-than-life films. A single line from <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>--&#x201c;Who could ever have thought a good little girl like you could destroy all my beautiful wickedness?&#x201d;--had a direct impact on John Waters. &#x201c;That line inspired my life,&#x201d; Waters says. &#x201c;I sometimes say it to myself before I go to sleep, like a prayer.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this volume, directors as diverse as John Woo, Peter Bogdanovich, Michel Gondry, and Kevin Smith examine classic movies that inspired them to tell stories. Here are 30 inspired and inspiring discussions of classic films that shaped the careers of today&#x2019;s directors and, in turn, cinema history. </p></p><p>Robert K. Elder&#x2019;s work has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, Salon.com, and elsewhere. His books include <i>John Woo: Interviews</i> and <i>Last Words of the Executed</i>.Thirty disparate directors discuss their transformative moviegoing experiences in this collection of revealing and entertaining interviews. The subjects cover the cinematic gamut, from mainstream veterans (Arthur Hiller, Bill Condon), art-house auteurs (Guy Maddin, Atom Egoyan), and young turks (Jay Duplass, Richard Kelly) to cult figures (Kevin Smith, John Waters), documentarians (Alex Gibney, Steve James) and animators (Pete Docter, Chris Miller). Some watched their pivotal flick as children&#x2014;John Landis saw the fantasy epic The 7th Voyage of Sinbad at age eight and said, &#x201c;Hey, I could do that&#x201d;&#x2014;while others were already committed to the medium and viewed their picks in film school. Many of the choices show an obvious influence&#x2014;for instance, John Woo, renowned for his hard-boiled Hong Kong crime epics, cited Rebel without a Cause and Mean Streets&#x2014;but others are genuinely surprising, such as horror auteur George Romero&#x2019;s picking Michael Powell&#x2019;s opera adaptation The Tales of Hoffmann. The discussions provide insight not only into the chosen films&#x2014;most have been viewed repeatedly by the enthusiastic interviewees&#x2014;but also into the directors&#x2019; own works. Their heartfelt and passionate tributes are cinephilia made concrete. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>Abe Lincoln at Last!

This probably isn't the first book about selling that you have read. Chances are you have seen and read a lot of other books, books that promise to give you the "secrets," the magic, the inspiration. You probably already know a lot about how to hype yourself by looking in the mirror every morning and repeating certain phrases to yourself. By now you know the mysteries of "PMLA" and "HPD" and some other magical-power expressions and attitude builders. You know a lot about what you should think and what you shouldn't think, positive and negative. And maybe you are a little confused by this time from all the contradictory advice the books have offered.</p><p>I don't want to take anything away from the promoters, the experts, and the other well-meaning people who grind out all those books. They have to make a living too.</p><p>But let's face it. What you want to know is how to sell real products and services now. And most of those authors never sold very much in their lives, except their books. They may be professional writers or professional sales training experts. Some of them may have spent a few weeks or months selling something until they figured out something at which they were better. And maybe one of them made a good living selling one multimillion-dollar real estate development every two years, which has nothing to do with the kind of selling you do and want to do better.</p><p>That's the point. They just aren't our kind of salesman, out there selling every day for a living. They don't do it because they have to. When you read their books, they sound fine. And they probably give you a little help, maybe even enough to earn back what they cost you. But when you think about those books, you realize pretty soon that these writers -- even the best of them -- just aren't our kind of salesman.</p><p>But I am. I sold cars and trucks. New ones, at retail, no fleet deals, just new cars and trucks, one at a time, face to face, belly to belly, to the same kind of people you sell to, every day. Maybe you sell cars or suits or houses or appliances or furniture or something else, day in and day out, something that you have to sell a lot of to make out. And when you read these books by the experts, you probably have the same gut reaction I do: There's something missing. What is missing, your intuition tells you, is first-hand, on-the-job involvement with <i>our</i> problems, <i>our</i> people, <i>our</i> world. Those guys just don't feel like they've been out there in the trenches every day the way we have to be if we're going to eat tomorrow.</p><p>That's why my book is different. That's why this book is going to work for you in ways that the others never did. Because I was out there every day the way you are. I did what you do. I felt what you feel. I wanted what you want. And I got it. Other people have been called the world's greatest salesman. But they aren't our kind of salesman. Among our kind of salesman, I am the world's greatest. You don't have to take my word for that claim. If you want to check me out, take a look at the world's foremost authority, the <i>Guinness Book of Records.</i> To prove I am not A.T.A.N.A. (all talk and no action) like the others that say they are #1 with their self-proclaimed records, my claim was audited by one of the top auditing firms, Deloitte &amp; Touche (letter available upon request). Look up the world's greatest salesman. You'll find that it's me, Joe Girard. Or check stories about me in <i>Newsweek, Forbes, Penthouse,</i> and <i>Woman's Day,</i> or in hundreds of other magazines and newspapers. You've probably seen me on one or another national television show in recent years. And they always introduce me as "the world's greatest salesman" as attested by the <i>Guinness Book of Records.</i></p><p>How well did I do after I started selling in 1963? In my first year, I sold only 267 cars. Only! Even those days that would be more than just a living. In that first year, I was maybe the top guy in the dealership. In 1966, my fourth year, I sold 614 cars and trucks (retail). This is the year I became NUMBER ONE RETAIL CAR AND TRUCK SALESMAN IN THE WORLD. And every year since, I was the NUMBER ONE RETAIL CAR AND TRUCK SALESMAN, increasing my business better than 10 percent a year and some years as high as 20 percent, even when we had bad recessions, layoffs, and long strikes. In fact, the worse the economy got, the smarter I worked and the better I did. I have stayed on top even when the auto dealers in the Detroit area cut the workweek from six days to five.</p><p><i>In 1976, which was my biggest year, I had gross earnings from commissions in excess of $300,000.</i> Not too many beat me, except maybe those guys who spend three years paying off some cabinet minister in some country to buy their airplanes or missiles. But that's not the kind of selling you and I are talking about.</p><p>What we are talking about is a profession that uses skills and tools and experience and practice. It brings us lots of headaches and frustrations, no matter how well we do. But when we do it right, it brings us more financial and emotional pleasure than any other kind of work in the world. I did what I did because I love the money and the excitement and the satisfaction of winning again and again and again.</p><p>You may already be doing pretty well. You may have a home, a vacation place, a boat, and a couple of cars. But if you have read this far, you think there is more to be had than that. And you're right. There is more of all the kinds of pride and satisfaction every good salesman should feel. In fact, the better you are, the more you should want. If you think you have enough of everything, then you aren't doing as well as you could, so keep on reading. Because I have a total system for selling that is a lot like farming in a country where things grow all the time. With my system, you do a lot of things that are like planting seeds. You do them all the time, and then you begin to harvest -- all the time. And every time you have harvested a sale, you plant something else. You plant and plant and harvest and harvest -- all the time -- through every season. There is nothing like it. I guarantee it.</p><p>But if you think that there is nothing you can do to sell and win, because you're a loser, let me tell you that I was a bigger loser than you have ever been.</p><p>For the first 35 years of my life I was the world's biggest loser. I got thrown out of high school. I got thrown out of about 40 different jobs. I lasted only 97 days in the U.S. Army. I couldn't even make it as a crook. I tried twice. The first time I wound up with nothing but a night of terror in juvenile detention. The second time the charges against me were dismissed for lack of evidence. And when I finally got into a business where I was making a small but fairly steady income, the first time I tried to expand I wound up facing bankruptcy, owing more money than I had ever seen, because I believed somebody who had no reason to tell me the truth.</p><p>How I got from there to here is what this book is about. This book is not being written by a spectator with a fancy title and a lot of degrees. This is being written by a working salesman who was in the front lines every day selling. Even when I travel around the country giving talks to other salesmen, I am selling, because salesmen have to be sold that the people who show them how to do it know how to do it because they did it. The story of how I got to be the world's greatest salesman gives me an enormous amount of pride. But I get even more from the letters I receive from working salesmen who meet me and hear me talk and then write telling me how I have changed their lives by making them better, happier, more prosperous salesmen.</p><p><b>WINNING BLOODLESS VICTORIES</b></p><p>Remember that for a real salesman there is nothing better than selling. It is like home runs for a hitter, touchdowns for a running back, victories for a general. But when a salesman sells there are no losers. Both the buyer and the seller win if it's a good sale. The confrontation that leads to a sale is like a game or a war, but one where nobody bleeds, nobody loses, everybody wins. What's better than that?</p><p>But the process that leads to that victory should start long before you ever see your prospect for the first time. And it goes on long after the customer signs the order, pays, and leaves with his purchase. In fact, if you think the sale ends when, like they say in the car business, you see the customer's taillights, you're going to lose more sales than you ever dreamed of. But if you understand how selling can be a continuing process that never ends, then you're going to make it to the big time.</p><p>Once my selling system got into high gear, I never had to look for customers among the people who walk into the front door of the showroom. I didn't take "ups." All my customers in those days were people who asked for me by name. All of them. And for every 10 sales I made, roughly 6 of them were to people I sold at least once before. And we're talking about automobiles. People buy them about every three or four years, and even less often among the middle- and working-class people who were most of my sales. If you're selling clothes or booze or things that people buy a lot more often, getting them back again and again is even more important. But it is harder to do with cars. So if I can show you the ways I kept people coming back to buy cars from me, you know it's going to mean even more sales for you if you're selling these other kinds of products and services where success depends even more on bringing them back again.</p><p>I guarantee you that my system will work for you, if you understand it and follow it. I looked at selling situations and customers in different ways than I once did. This means that I have changed my attitude about a lot of aspects of my profession. I know there are a lot of people who talk about the importance of attitudes. They tell you that if you change your attitude toward somet...</p></p><h2>The Crow: Special Edition</h2><p>When James O&#x2019;Barr poured the pain and anguish of a personal tragedy into the drawings that comprise <i>The Crow</i>, his intensely cathartic story of Eric&#x2014;who returns from the dead to avenge his and his fianc�e&#x2019;s murder at the hands of a street gang&#x2014;resonated with readers around the world.

The unstoppable manhunter with the very itchy trigger finger stars in <em>Pronto</em>, a crime fiction gem from the one and only Elmore Leonard, &#x201c;the greatest crime writer of our time, perhaps ever&#x201d; (<em>New York Times Book Review</em>). The Grand Master justifies the overwhelming acclaim he has received over the course of his remarkable career with an electrifying thriller that sends the indomitable Raylan racing to Italy on the trail of a fugitive bookie who&#x2019;s hiding from the vengeful Miami mob. The legendary Leonard, whom the <em>Seattle Times</em> lauds as the &#x201c;King Daddy of crime writers,&#x201d; proves that all comparisons to American noir icons John D. MacDonald, Dashiell Hammett, and James M. Cain are well deserved with this tale of very dirty doings and extremely dangerous men coming together in the birthplace of Puccini, Garibaldi, and La Cosa Nostra.<br></p></p><p>In the world of Elmore Leonard novels, cops and criminals get by with a grudging respect for each other's capabilities: <blockquote> Harry had been arrested by Buck Torres a half-dozen times or so; they knew each other pretty well and were friends. Not socially, Harry had never met Buck's wife, but friends in the way they trusted one another and always had time to talk about other things than what they did for a living. </blockquote> Right now, 66-year-old Harry Arno's in trouble. In order to get at his boss, Jimmy Cap, the feds told Jimmy that Harry's skimming off the sports book he runs, the idea being that Harry will testify in exchange for protection from Tommy Bucks (a.k.a. the Zip), Jimmy's enforcer. But Harry's got a few tricks up his sleeve. Then when a straight-shooting U.S. Marshall decides to spend his vacation tracking Harry down, all hell breaks loose. Set in Miami, Florida, and Rapallo, Italy, <i>Pronto</i> is another brilliantly executed combination of suspense and black humor from the master of crime fiction. <i>--Ron Hogan</i>Well-known South Miami Beach bookie Harry Arno was grossing seven thousand aweek running sports bets. He split fifty-fifty with local wiseguy JimmyCapotorto, aka Jimmy Cap, but by skimming off the top for twenty years, Harryhad stashed away enough to retire. Everything was set for his name-change andvanishing act to the Italian Riviera with his girlfirend, Joyce (Joy, when shewas a topless dancer), right after the Super Bowl. Harry Arno felt like alucky man.<p>He felt wrong. An FBI assault on organized crime had targeted Jimmy Cap, andHarry was set up as the fall guy to help them do it.

The recent political cycle has shattered the lens through which the American church has looked at politics through much of our lifetimes. If we return to the Scriptures, we see Jesus offers us a compelling, alternative vision. His heart was that His followers would be a city on a hill and that people would see our good deeds and glorify our Father in heaven. This was not dependent on the laws on the books, the rulings of the courts, or the leaders in power. His heart was that we would influence culture through redemptive participation, being not just a faithful, but also a fruitful presence. His vision was that the church functions as a Creative Minority in a dominant culture. A Creative Minority seeks not to propose a way to regain cultural dominance, take back our world for God or revisit an unrealistic and nostalgic past. It humbly proposes that if we take on the posture and identity of a Creative Minority, we may rekindle the light in the bushel, and in so doing, cast a hopeful glimmer on the world. A Creative Minority paints a compelling picture of the way the church is called to participate in these challenging and demanding times - seeking neither to control nor abandon the world, but to love it to new life through redemptive participation.</p><p>Jon Tyson is a Pastor and Church Planter in New York City.&nbsp;Originally from Adelaide Australia, Jon moved to the United States twenty years ago with a passion to seek and cultivate renewal in the Western Church.

Newly in love, he is beginning to put a difficult past behind him. Then a local college student goes missing, and Will is inexplicably kept off the case by his supervisor and mentor, deputy director Amanda Wagner. Will cannot fathom Amanda&#x2019;s motivation until the two of them literally collide in an abandoned orphanage they have both been drawn to for different reasons. Decades before, when his father was imprisoned for murder, this was Will&#x2019;s home. It appears that the case that launched Amanda&#x2019;s career forty years ago has suddenly come back to life&#x2014;and it involves the long-held mystery of Will&#x2019;s birth and parentage.

The lights from the console showed narrow, beady eyes tracing along the line of girls standing under the street sign. Jane. Mary. Lydia. The car stopped. Predictably, the man tilted up his chin toward Kitty. She trotted over, adjusting her miniskirt as she navigated her spiked heels across the uneven asphalt. Two weeks ago, when Juice had first brought Kitty onto the corner, she&#x2019;d told the other girls she was sixteen, which probably meant fifteen, though she looked no older than twelve.<br><br> They had all hated her on sight.<br><br> Kitty leaned down into the open window of the car. Her stiff vinyl skirt tipped up like the bottom of a bell. She always got picked first, which was becoming a problem that everyone but Juice could see. Kitty got special favors. She could talk men into doing anything. The girl was fresh, childlike, though like all of them, she carried a kitchen knife in her purse and knew how to use it. Nobody wanted to do what they were doing, but to have another girl&#x2014;a newer girl&#x2014;picked over them hurt just as much as if they were all standing on the sidelines at the debutante ball.<br><br> Inside the Oldsmobile, the transaction was quickly negotiated, no haggling because what was on offer was still worth the price. Kitty made the signal to Juice, waited for his nod, then got into the car. The muffler chugged exhaust as the Olds made a wide turn onto a narrow side street. The car shook once as the gear was shoved into park. The driver&#x2019;s hand flew up, clamped around the back of Kitty&#x2019;s head, and she disappeared.<br><br> Lucy Bennett turned away, looking up the dark, soulless avenue. No headlights coming. No traffic. No business. Atlanta wasn&#x2019;t a nighttime town. The last person to leave the Equitable building usually turned off the lights, but Lucy could see the bulbs from the Flatiron glowing clear across Central City Park. If she squinted hard enough, she could find the familiar green of the C&amp;S sign that anchored the business district. The New South. Progress through commerce. The City Too Busy to Hate.<br><br> If there were men out walking these streets tonight, it was with no amount of good on their minds.<br><br> Jane lit a smoke, then tucked the pack back into her purse. She wasn&#x2019;t the kind to share, but she was certainly the kind to take. Her eyes met Lucy&#x2019;s. The dead in them was hard to look at. Jane must&#x2019;ve felt the same. She quickly glanced away.<br><br> Lucy shivered, even though it was the middle of August, heat wafting off the pavement like smoke from a fire. Her feet were sore. Her back ached. Her head was pounding like a metronome. Her gut felt like she&#x2019;d swallowed a truckload of concrete. Cotton filled her mouth. Her hands felt the constant prick of pins and needles. A clump of her blonde hair had come out in the sink this morning. She had turned nineteen two days ago and already she was an old woman.<br><br> In the side street, the brown Olds shook again. Kitty&#x2019;s head came up. She wiped her mouth as she got out of the car. No dawdling. No giving the john time to reconsider his purchase. The car drove away before she could shut the door, and Kitty teetered for a moment on the high heels, looking lost, afraid, and then angry. They were all angry. Fury was their refuge, their comfort, the only thing that they could truly call their own.<br><br> Lucy watched Kitty pick her way back toward the corner. She gave Juice the cash, trying to keep her forward momentum, but he caught her arm to make her stop. Kitty spat on the sidewalk, trying to look like she wasn&#x2019;t terrified as Juice unfolded the wad of cash, counted off each bill. Kitty stood there, waiting. They all waited.<br><br> Finally, Juice lifted his chin. The money was good. Kitty took her place back in the line. She didn&#x2019;t look at any of the other girls. She just stared blankly into the street, waiting for the next car to roll up, waiting for the next man who would either give her a nod or pass her by. It&#x2019;d taken two days, tops, for her eyes to develop the same dead look as the rest of the girls. What was going through her mind? Probably the same as Lucy, that familiar chant that rocked her to sleep every night: When-will-this-be-over? When-will-this-be-over? When-will-this-be-over?<br><br> Lucy had been fifteen once. From this distance, she could barely remember that girl. Passing notes in class. Giggling about boys. Rushing home from school every day to watch her soap. Dancing in her room to the Jackson Five with her best friend, Jill Henderson. Lucy was fifteen years old, and then life had opened up like a chasm, and little Lucy had plummeted down, down into the unrelenting darkness.<br><br> She had started taking speed to lose weight. Just pills at first. Benzedrine, which her friend Jill had found in her mother&#x2019;s medicine cabinet. They took them sparingly, cautiously, until the feds had gone crazy and banned the pills. The medicine cabinet was empty one day, and the next&#x2014;or so it seemed&#x2014;Lucy&#x2019;s weight ballooned back up to well over one hundred fifty pounds. She was the only overweight kid in school save for Fat George, the boy who picked his nose and sat by himself at the lunch table. Lucy hated him the same way he hated her, the same way she hated her own reflection in the mirror.<br><br> It was Jill&#x2019;s mother who taught Lucy how to shoot up. Mrs. Henderson wasn&#x2019;t stupid; she had noticed the missing pills, been pleased to see Lucy finally doing something to get rid of her baby fat. The woman availed herself of the drug for the same reason. She was a nurse at Clayton General Hospital. She walked out of the emergency room with glass vials of Methedrine chattering like teeth in the pocket of her white uniform. Injectable amphetamine, she told Lucy. The same as the pills, only faster.<br><br> Lucy was fifteen years old the first time the needle pierced her skin.<br><br> &#x201c;Just a little bit at a time,&#x201d; Mrs. Henderson coached, drawing a red tinge of blood into the syringe, then slowly pressing home the plunger. &#x201c;You control it. Don&#x2019;t let it control you.&#x201d;<br><br> There was no real high, just a lightheadedness, and then of course the welcome loss of appetite. Mrs. Henderson was right. The liquid was faster than the pills, easier. Five pounds. Ten pounds. Fifteen. Then&#x2014;nothing. So Lucy had redefined her &#x201c;just a little bit at a time&#x201d; until she was drawing back not five cc&#x2019;s, but ten, then ten turned to fifteen, then her head exploded and she was on fire.<br><br> What did she care about after that?<br><br> Nothing.<br><br> Boys? Too stupid. Jill Henderson? What a drag. Her weight? Never again.<br><br> By the age of sixteen, Lucy was just under a hundred pounds. Her ribs, her hips, her elbows, jutted out like polished marble. For the first time in her life, she had cheekbones. She wore dark Cleopatra eyeliner and blue eye shadow and ironed her long blonde hair so that it slapped stiffly against her impossibly thin ass. The little girl her fifth-grade PE coach had, much to the delight of the rest of the class, nicknamed &#x201c;Steam Roller&#x201d; was model-thin, carefree, and&#x2014;suddenly&#x2014;popular.<br><br> Not popular with her old friends, the ones she had known since kindergarten. They all spurned her as a waste, a dropout, a loser. For once in her life, Lucy didn&#x2019;t care. Who needed people who looked down on you for having a little fun? Lucy had only ever been a token anyway&#x2014;the fat girl to pal around with so the other girl could be the pretty one, the charming one, the one all the boys flirted with.<br><br> Her new friends thought Lucy was perfect. They loved it when she made a sarcastic quip about someone from her old life. They embraced her weirdness. The girls invited her to their parties. The boys asked her out. They treated her as an equal. She finally fit in with a group. She finally didn&#x2019;t stick out as too anything. She was just one of many. She was just Lucy.<br><br> And what of her old life? Lucy felt nothing but disdain for everyone who had inhabited it, especially Mrs. Henderson, who abruptly cut her off and said Lucy needed to get her shit together. Lucy&#x2019;s shit was more together than it had ever been. She had no intention whatsoever of giving up her new life.<br><br> All of her old friends were squares, obsessed with college prep, which mostly consisted of debating which sorority they would rush. The finer points of these sororities, whose Victorian and Greek Revival&#x2013;style mansions dotted Milledge Avenue and South Lumpkin Street at the University of Georgia, had been part of Lucy&#x2019;s vernacular since the age of ten, but the lure of amphetamine reduced her Greek to a forgotten language. She didn&#x2019;t need the disapproving glances from her old friends. She didn&#x2019;t even need Mrs. Henderson anymore. There were plenty of new friends who could hook her up, and Lucy&#x2019;s parents were generous with her allowance. On the weeks she was short, her mother never noticed money missing from her purse.</p><h2>Growing Up God&#39;s Way for Girls</h2><p>Growing up God s way is a colourful, fully illustrated book available as<br>separate versions for boys and girls.

They need safe places to live, and safe places to play.&#x201d; For some kids, this means living with foster parents. In simple words and full-color illustrations, this book explains why some kids move to foster homes, what foster parents do, and ways kids might feel during foster care. Children often believe that they are in foster care because they are &#x201c;bad.&#x201d; This book makes it clear that the troubles in their lives are not their fault; the message throughout is one of hope and support. Includes resources and information for parents, foster parents, social workers, counselors, and teachers.</p><p>Julie Nelson is passionately committed to supporting society&#x2019;s most highly stressed children. She is a teacher and home visitor for the Families Together Preschool, a nonprofit early intervention program, and an instructor at the University of Minnesota Center for Early Education and Development.Pres-Grade 1&#x2013;Meant to reassure children in foster care, this accumulation of short, declarative sentences stresses the importance of being safe. The illustrations show a multiethnic cast of kids and adults, some in positive situations and others in more stressful settings. The first half of the book discusses, in the briefest possible terms, why kids end up in foster care, and the second half talks about foster parents and other adults in supporting roles. There is virtually no transition from one thought to the next, giving a random feel to the text. With only 10 spreads, the extreme brevity alone imposes some limits. Still, the information presented seems arbitrary, at best. One entire spread is devoted to the statement, Usually moms and dads take good care of kids and keep kids safe. If the audience for the book is truly the one stated in the subtitle, why emphasize what these children's parents have failed to do? The rather ordinary paintings are weakest at reflecting facial expressions. A brief but helpful informational message for adults is appended, giving tips on helping foster children work through their difficult emotions, and a list of adult resources is also included. The book does offer validation of a living situation that affects thousands of children in the U.S. each year and explains it in a straightforward style, albeit with mediocre results.<i>&#x2013;Faith Brautigam, Gail Borden Public Library, Elgin, IL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But the number of people and disciplines involved in a building's creation make it hard to understand the process as a whole. <em>The Birth of a Building</em> is an introduction to those aspects of finance, law, urban planning, architecture, engineering, construction, and real estate development which underlie this fascinating event.</p><p>Part One focuses on the "birds and the bees," explaining the economic story which motivates people to create new buildings in the first place. Part Two focuses on the longer pregnancy and delivery process, walking you through the specific stages that a building project will pass through. Every chapter begins with a simple analogy from everyday life that helps the total beginner relate to the subject matter. And because it takes an interdisciplinary approach, <em>The Birth of a Building</em> can serve as an introduction to many different fields.</p></p><p>Ben stevens received an mba in Real Estate and Urban Land Economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

You feel a deep and growing conviction that you must do something to disciple your daughter. But what? How can a busy mom make sure her daughter learns about the most important things in life: what Jesus did for her on the cross and how to be faithful to him in this broken world?</p> <p>Author Trish Donohoe has been there, and that&#x2019;s why she wrote&nbsp;<em>Between Us Girls: Walks and Talks for Moms and Daughters</em>. These twenty-six gospel-driven talks are a fun and easy guide for mothers who want to disciple their daughters but don&#x2019;t know where to start.

Ultimately, Donohoe&#x2019;s book teaches mothers and daughters a new way to communicate and starts them on a wonderful, lifelong journey of getting to know one another better and learning to love their Savior more. Written by a busy mom for busy moms, so no prep time is needed!

Such series often provide questions with little guidance, leaving students to their own devices. They thus tend to overlook the role of teaching in the church. By contrast, Knowing the Bible avoids the problem by providing substantial instruction with the questions. Knowing the Bible then goes even further by showing how any given passage connects with the gospel, the whole Bible, and Christian theology. I heartily endorse this orientation of individual books to the whole Bible and the gospel, and I applaud the demonstration that sound theology was not something invented later by Christians, but is right there in the pages of Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy,</strong>&nbsp;Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;What a gift to earnest, Bible-loving, Bible-searching believers!

FRANKL</b></p><p></p><p>PREFACE</p><p>This book is the outcome of a series of lectures I was invited to give during the 1966 summer session of Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. The particular task assigned to me at that time was to explain the system that characterizes logotherapy. While it has often been pointed out by various authors that logotherapy, in contrast to the other schools of existential psychiatry, has developed a proper psychotherapeutic technique, it has scarcely been noticed that it also is the last psychotherapy that is conceptualized in a systematic way.1</p><p>Dealing with the <i>foundations</i> of the system, the chapters of this book set forth the basic assumptions and tenets underlying logotherapy. They form a chain of links interconnected with one another, in that logotherapy is based on the following three concepts: (1) the freedom of will; (2) the will to meaning; and (3) the meaning of life. (1) The freedom of will involves the issue of determinism versus pan-determinism. (2) The will to meaning is discussed as distinct from the concepts of the will to power and the will to pleasure as they are presented by Adlerian and Freudian psychology, respectively. To be sure, the term, will to power, was coined by Nietzsche rather than Adler, and the term, will to pleasure&#x2014;standing for Freud&#x2019;s pleasure principle&#x2014;is my own and not Freud&#x2019;s. Moreover, the pleasure principle should be seen in the light of a broader concept, the homeostasis principle.2 While criticizing both concepts, we shall have to elaborate on logotherapy&#x2019;s motivational theory. (3) The meaning of life relates to the issue of relativism versus subjectivism.</p><p>The <i>applications</i> of logotherapy discussed in this book are also threefold. First of all, logotherapy is applicable as a treatment of noogenic neuroses; second, logotherapy is a treatment of psychogenic neuroses, i.e., neuroses in the conventional sense of the word; and third, logotherapy is a treatment of somatogenic neuroses or, for that matter, somatogenic diseases in general. As we see, all the dimensions of a human being are reflected in this sequence of subject matters.</p><p>In the introductory chapter of this book, logotherapy is placed in perspective with other schools of psychotherapy, and, specifically, with existentialism in the field of psychotherapy. The last chapter deals with the dialogue between logotherapy and theology.</p><p>I have tried in this book to include the latest development of logotherapy with respect to both the formulation of the individual tenets and the material serving as an illustration. However, the attempt to offer a rounded picture of the whole system compels me to include some material which has been used in my previous books.3</p><p>What I term the existential vacuum constitutes a challenge to psychiatry today. Ever more patients complain of a feeling of emptiness and meaninglessness, which seems to me to derive from two facts. Unlike an animal, man is not told by instincts what he <i>must</i> do. And unlike man in former times, he is no longer told by traditions what he <i>should</i> do. Often he does not even know what he basically wishes to do. Instead, either he wishes to do what other people do (conformism), or he does what other people wish him to do (totalitarianism).</p><p>I hope that I shall be successful in conveying to the reader my conviction that, despite the crumbling of traditions, life holds a meaning for each and every individual, and even more, it retains this meaning literally to his last breath. And the psychiatrist can show his patient that life never ceases to have a meaning. To be sure, he cannot show his patient <i>what</i> the meaning is, but he may well show him that <i>there is</i> a meaning, and that life retains it: that it remains meaningful, under any conditions. As logotherapy teaches, even the tragic and negative aspects of life, such as unavoidable suffering, can be turned into a human achievement by the attitude which a man adopts toward his predicament. In contrast to most of the existentialist schools of thought, logotherapy is in no way pessimistic; but it is realistic in that it faces the tragic triad of human existence: pain, death, and guilt. Logotherapy may justly be called optimistic, because it shows the patient how to transform despair into triumph.</p><p>In an age such as ours, in which traditions are on the wane, psychiatry must see its principal assignment in equipping man with the ability to find meaning. In an age in which the Ten Commandments seem to many people to have lost their unconditional validity, man must learn to listen to the ten thousand commandments implied in the ten thousand situations of which his life consists. In this respect I hope the reader will find that logotherapy speaks to the needs of the hour.</p><p>VIKTOR E. FRANKL, M.D., PH.D.</p><p><i>Vienna, Austria</i></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p><i>The Situation of Psychotherapy and the Position of Logotherapy</i></p><p>The present situation of psychotherapy is characterized by the rise of existential psychiatry. In fact, one could speak of an inoculation of existentialism in psychiatry as a major contemporary trend. But in speaking of existentialism we must bear in mind that there are as many existentialisms as there are existentialists. Moreover, not only has each existentialist molded his own version of the philosophy, but also each uses the nomenclature differently from the way others use it. For example, such terms as existence and <i>Dasein</i> have meanings deviating from each other in the writings of Jaspers and Heidegger.</p><p>Nonetheless, the individual authors in the field of existential psychiatry have something in common&#x2014;a common denominator. It is the phrase so often used by these authors&#x2014;and all too often misused by them: &#x201c;being in the world.&#x201d; One gets the impression that many of these authors think it is a sufficient credential to be considered a true existentialist if they apply the phrase &#x201c;being in the world&#x201d; time and again. I doubt that this is a sufficient ground for calling oneself an existentialist, particularly since, as could easily be demonstrated, in most cases Heidegger&#x2019;s concept of being in the world is misconceived in the direction of mere subjectivism&#x2014;as though &#x201c;the world&#x201d; in which a human being &#x201c;is&#x201d; were nothing but a self-expression of the being himself. I venture to criticize this widespread misconception only because, as it happens, I once had an opportunity to discuss it in personal conversation with Martin Heidegger himself, and found that he agreed with me.</p><p>Misunderstandings in the field of existentialism may be understood easily. The terminology is sometimes esoteric, to say the least. About thirty years ago, I had to give a public lecture on psychiatry and existentialism in Vienna. I confronted my audience with two quotations and told them that one was taken from Heidegger&#x2019;s writings while the other was part of a conversation that I had had with a schizophrenic patient institutionalized in Vienna&#x2019;s state hospital where I was then on the staff. And then I invited my audience to vote on which one was whose. Believe it or not, an overwhelming majority thought that the passage quoted from Heidegger was the utterance of a schizophrenic patient and vice versa. However, we must not draw rash conclusions from the result of this experiment. By no means does it speak against the greatness of Heidegger&#x2014;and let us take it for granted that he is as great as many experts believe. Rather it speaks against the capacity of everyday language to express thoughts and feelings hitherto unknown&#x2014;be they revolutionary ideas created by a great philosopher, or strange feelings experienced by a schizophrenic individual. What unites them is a crisis of expression, as it were, and elsewhere I have shown that something analogous holds for the modern artist (see my book, <i>Psychotherapy and Existentialism, Selected Papers on Logotherapy</i>, Washington Square Press, New York, 1967, the chapter on &#x201c;Psychotherapy, Art and Religion&#x201d;).</p><p>As to the position of the method I have called logotherapy, which is the subject of this book, most authors agree that it falls under the category of existential psychiatry. In fact, as early as the thirties I coined the word <i>Existenzanalyse</i> as an alternative name for logotherapy, which I had coined in the twenties. Later on, when American authors started publishing in the field of logotherapy they introduced the term &#x201c;existential analysis&#x201d; as a translation of <i>Existenzanalyse</i>. Unfortunately, other authors did the same with the word <i>Daseinsanalyse</i>&#x2014;a term which, in the forties, had been selected by the late Ludwig Binswanger, the great Swiss psychiatrist, to denote his own teachings. Since then existential analysis has become quite an ambiguous word. In order not to add to the confusion which had been aroused by this state of affairs, I decided to refrain more and more from using the term existential analysis in my publications in English. Often I speak of logotherapy even in a context where no therapy in the strict sense of the word is involved. What I call medical ministry, for example, forms an important aspect of the practice of logotherapy but it is indicated precisely in those cases where actual therapy is impossible because the patient is confronted with an incurable disease. Yet, in the widest possible sense, logotherapy <i>is</i> treatment even then&#x2014;it is treatment of the patient&#x2019;s attitude toward his unchangeable fate.</p><p>Logotherapy has not only been subsumed under the heading of existential psychiatry but has also been acclaimed, within this province, as the only school which has succeeded in developing what one might be justified in calling a technique. However, this is not to say that we logotherapists overrate the importance of techniques. One has long ago come to realize that what matters in therapy is not techniques but rather the human relations between doctor and patient, or the personal and existential encounter.</p><p>A purely technological approach to psychotherapy may block its therapeutic effect. Some time ago I was invited to lecture at an American university before a team of psychiatrists who had been assigned the care of the evacuees after a hurricane. I not only accepted this invitation but even selected the title, &#x201c;Techniques and Dynamics of Survival,&#x201d; a title that obviously pleased the sponsors of my lecture. But when I started this lecture I frankly told them that as long as we actually interpret our task merely in terms of techniques and dynamics we have missed the point&#x2014;and we have missed the hearts of those to whom we wish to offer mental first aid. Approaching human beings merely in terms of techniques necessarily implies manipulating them, and approaching them merely in terms of dynamics implies reifying them, making human beings into mere things. And these human beings immediately feel and notice the manipulative quality of our approach and our tendency to reify them. I would say, reification has become the original sin of psychotherapy. But a human being is no thing. This <i>no-thingness, rather than nothingness, is the lesson to learn from existentialism.</i></p><p>When, on the occasion of another lecture tour, I was asked to address the prisoners at San Quentin I was assured, afterward, that in a way it was the first time they really felt understood. What I had done was nothing so extraordinary. I had simply taken them as human beings and not mistaken them for mechanisms to repair. I had interpreted them in the same way they had interpreted themselves all along, that is to say, as free and responsible. I had not offered them a cheap escape from guilt feelings by conceiving of them as victims of biological, psychological, or sociological conditioning processes. Nor had I taken them as helpless pawns on the battleground of id, ego, and superego. I had not provided them with an alibi. Guilt had not been taken away from them. I had not explained it away. I had taken them as peers. They learned that it was a prerogative of man to become guilty&#x2014;and his responsibility to overcome guilt.</p><p>What did I implement when addressing the prisoners at San Quentin if not phenomenology in the truest sense? In fact, phenomenology is an attempt to describe the way in which man understands himself, in which he interprets his own existence, far from preconceived patterns of interpretation and explanation such as are furnished by psychodynamic or socioeconomic hypotheses. In adopting the phenomenological methodology, logotherapy, as Paul Polak1 once put it, tries to couch man&#x2019;s unbiased self-understanding in scientific terms.</p><p>Let me again take up the issue of technique versus encounter. Psychotherapy is more than mere technique in that it is art, and it goes beyond pure science in that it is wisdom. But even wisdom is not the last word. In a concentration camp I once saw the body of a woman who had committed suicide. Among her effects there was a scrap of paper on which she had written the words: &#x201c;More powerful than fate is the courage that bears it.&#x201d; Despite this motto she had taken her life. Wisdom is lacking without the human touch.</p><p>Recently, I received a telephone call at three in the morning from a lady who told me that she was determined to commit suicide but was curious to know what I would say about it. I replied with all the arguments against this resolution and for survival, and I talked to her for thirty minutes&#x2014;until she finally gave her word that she would not take her life but rather come to see me in the hospital. But when she visited me there it turned out that not one of all the arguments I offered had impressed her. The only reason she had decided not to commit suicide was the fact that, ra...</p></p><h2>Anywhere Travel Guide: 75 Cards for Discovering the Unexpected, Wherever Your Journey Leads (Travel Games for Adults, Exploration and Discovery Games)</h2><p>A creative travel guide for anywhere, this handy deck includes 75 cards to inspire exploration.

There was a room downstairs complete with a fifty-inch TV and surround sound, not to mention the pool table, and the (heated) pool outside.<br><br> Even though I treated it like a second home the only place I felt really, really comfortable was in Lee&#x2019;s bedroom.<br><br> I opened the door and saw the sunlight spilling in through the open doors leading to his small balcony. Posters of bands covered the walls, his drum kit sat in the corner next to a guitar, and his Apple Mac was proudly displayed on a smart mahogany desk that matched the rest of the furniture.<br><br> But, just like any other sixteen-year-old boy&#x2019;s room, the floor was littered with T-shirts and underpants and stinky socks; a half-eaten sandwich festered next to the Apple Mac, and empty cans were strewn over almost every surface.<br><br> I launched myself onto Lee&#x2019;s bed, loving the way it bounced.<br><br> We&#x2019;d been best friends since we were born. Our moms both knew each other from college and I only lived a ten-minute walk away now. Lee and I had grown up together. We might as well have been twins: freakishly, we were born on the same day.<br><br> He was my best friend. Always had been and always will be. Even if he did annoy the hell out of me sometimes.<br><br> He turned up just at that moment, holding two opened bottles of orange soda, knowing I&#x2019;d have drunk his at some point anyway.<br><br> &#x2018;We need to decide what we&#x2019;re doing for the carnival,&#x2019; I said.<br><br> &#x2018;I know,&#x2019; he sighed, messing up his dark brown hair and scrunching up his freckled face. &#x2018;Can&#x2019;t we just do a coconut thing? You know, when they throw balls and try to knock the coconuts off?&#x2019;<br><br> I shook my head in wonder. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s what I was thinking . . .&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Of course it is.&#x2019;<br><br> I smirked a little. &#x2018;But we can&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s already taken.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Why do we have to come up with a booth anyway? Can&#x2019;t we just manage the whole event and make other people come up with the booths?&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Hey, you&#x2019;re the one who said being on the school council would look good on our college applications.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;You&#x2019;re the one who agreed to it.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Because I wanted to be on the dance committee,&#x2019; I pointed out. &#x2018;I didn&#x2019;t realize we had to work on the carnival too.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;This sucks.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;I know. Oh, hey, what about if we hired one of those, um . . . you know&#x2019;--I made a swinging gesture with my hands--&#x2018;those things with the hammer.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Where they test your strength?&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Yeah. That thing.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;No, they already ordered one of those.&#x2019;<br><br> I sighed. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know then. There&#x2019;s not much left--everything&#x2019;s already taken.&#x2019;<br><br> We looked at each other and both said, &#x2018;I told you we should&#x2019;ve started planning this earlier.&#x2019;<br><br> We laughed, and Lee sat at his computer, spinning around on the chair slowly.<br><br> &#x2018;Haunted house?&#x2019;<br><br> I gave him a deadpan look--well, I tried. It wasn&#x2019;t easy to catch his eye when he was spinning around like that.<br><br> &#x2018;It&#x2019;s spring, Lee. Not Halloween.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Yeah, so?&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;No. No haunted house.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Fine,&#x2019; he grumbled. &#x2018;Then what do you suggest?&#x2019;<br><br> I shrugged. Truth was, I had no idea. We were pretty much screwed. If we didn&#x2019;t come up with a booth, then we&#x2019;d end up being booted off the council, which would mean we couldn&#x2019;t put it on our college applications next year.<br><br> &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know. I can&#x2019;t think when it&#x2019;s this hot.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Then take off your sweater and come up with something.&#x2019;<br><br> I rolled my eyes, and Lee started surfing Google for ideas for a booth for the Spring Carnival. I tugged my sweater off over my head, and felt the sun on my bare stomach. I tried to wriggle my arms back through so I could pull down the tank top I was wearing underneath . . .<br><br> &#x2018;Lee,&#x2019; I said, my voice muffled. &#x2018;A little help?&#x2019;<br><br> He sniggered at me, and I heard him get up. At that moment the bedroom door was pushed open, and I thought for a minute he&#x2019;d left me in a tangle, but the next second I heard a different voice.<br><br> &#x2018;Jeez, at least lock the door if you guys are going to do that.&#x2019;<br><br> I froze, my cheeks going bright pink as Lee tugged down my tank top and yanked the sweater off my head, leaving my hair static.<br><br> I looked up to see his older brother leaning against the door frame, smirking at me.<br><br> &#x2018;Hey, Shelly,&#x2019; he greeted me. He knew I hate being called Shelly. I let Lee get away with it, but Noah was another matter entirely. He did it solely to annoy me. Nobody else dared call me &#x2018;Shelly&#x2019;, not after I had yelled at Cam for it in the fourth grade. Now everybody called me Elle, short for Rochelle. Just like nobody else dared call him &#x2018;Noah&#x2019;, except for Lee and his parents; everyone else called him by his surname, Flynn.<br><br> &#x2018;Hi, Noah,&#x2019; I shot back with a sweet smile.<br><br> His jaw clenched and his dark eyebrows rose a little, like he was daring me to carry on calling him that. I just smiled back and the sexy smirk returned to his face.<br><br> Noah was just about the hottest guy to grace this earth; believe me, I&#x2019;m not exaggerating. He had dark hair that flopped into his electric blue eyes, and he was tall and broad shouldered. His nose was a little crooked from when it was broken in a fight and didn&#x2019;t set quite right--Noah wasn&#x2019;t a stranger to fights, but he&#x2019;d never been suspended. Aside from the occasional &#x2018;scrap&#x2019;, as Lee and I had taken to calling it, he was a model student: his grades never dropped below an A, and he was the star of the football team, too.<br><br> I used to have a crush on him when I was twelve or thirteen. It passed pretty quickly though, when I realized he was way out of my league and always would be. And even though he was unbelievably hot, I acted my normal self around him because I knew there wasn&#x2019;t a chance in hell that he&#x2019;d ever look at me as anything other than his kid brother&#x2019;s best friend.</p><h2>Black Pioneers of Science and Invention</h2><p>A readable, perceptive account of the lives of fourteen gifted innovators who have played important roles in scientific and industrial progress.

Born from British and design royalty, India Hicks has forged a design empire from her family&#x2019;s enclave in the Bahamas.

Soviets kept files on all foreigners, studied their patterns, and tapped their phones. Intelligence work was effectively impossible. The Soviet threat loomed larger than ever.<br><i>The Moscow Rules</i> tells the story of the intelligence breakthroughs that turned the odds in America's favor. As experts in disguise, Antonio and Jonna were instrumental in developing a series of tactics--Hollywood-inspired identity swaps, ingenious evasion techniques, and an armory of James Bond-style gadgets--that allowed CIA officers to outmaneuver the KGB.<br>As Russia again rises in opposition to America, this remarkable story is a tribute to those who risked everything for their country, and to the ingenuity that allowed them to succeed.</p><p><b>Antonio (Tony) Mendez</b> served in the CIA for twenty-five years and is a highly decorated CIA officer, one of the top fifty officers in its first fifty years. He received the Intelligence Star for Valor for the ARGO operation, the story of which was told in the 2013 movie of the same name. He is the author of the New York Times bestselling <i>Argo, The Master of Disguise</i>, and <i>Spy Dust</i>.<br><br><b>Jonna Mendez</b> is a former Chief of Disguise with over twenty-five years of experience as a CIA officer working in Moscow and other sensitive areas. She participated in a number of training exercises, along with Tony, which ultimately led to the codification of the rules. She co-wrote <i>Spy Dust</i> with her husband about their shared experience in Moscow during the twilight of the Cold War. Often cited for their expertise in the field, Jonna and Tony are both much sought-after speakers and consultants.<br><br><b>Matt Baglio</b> is the bestselling author who previously worked with Tony on <i>Argo</i>, and is also the author of <i>The Rite</i>."An insider's look at CIA operations in Moscow, the most challenging operational city in the world, revealing the tradecraft precepts used to keep priceless assets productive against overwhelming KGB surveillance. Written by two of the people who created these breakthrough tactics, <i>The Moscow Rules</i> takes you every step of the way on the snowy streets of Moscow."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Jason Matthews, <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling author of the Red Sparrow trilogy</b></i></b><br><br>"If there was ever a single book which could sum up the dangers, heroism, inventiveness and intrepidity of the intelligence officers of the CIA it is <i>The Moscow Rules</i>.

It's all in this book-the good, the bad, and the ugly, unflinchingly revealed. Tony and his wife and coauthor, Jonna, were two of the stars from the Office of Technical Service, CIA's version of James Bond's 'Q,' and key to so many of the agency's successes-and nowhere more so than in Moscow during the Cold War."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Jack Downing, former chief of station, Moscow, and the CIA's former deputy director for operations</b></i></b><br><br>"Intriguing true stories of the techniques of CIA spying on the dangerous front line of the Cold War."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Dame Stella Rimington, former director of MI5</b></i></b><br><br>"A gripping, interesting and relevant read... reads like a spy novel yet tells a true tale of the darkest days of the espionage war largely fought between the CIA and the KGB."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Cipher Brief</b></i></b></p><h2>Alfred's Basic Piano Library Top Hits!

He's seen ballplayers come and go, and he knows he could be one of the lucky ones. Maybe he'll make it to the top. Or maybe he'll stumble along the way. Slam's grades aren't that hot. And when his teachers jam his troubles in his face, he blows up.<br><br> Slam never doubted himself on the court until he found himself going one-on-one with his own future, and he didn't have the ball.</p><p>Walter Dean Myers is the 2012 - 2013 National Ambassador for Young People's Literature. He is the critically acclaimed New York Times bestselling author an award-winning body of work which includes, SOMEWHERE IN THE DARKNESS, SLAM!, and MONSTER. Mr. Myers has received two Newbery Honor medals, five Coretta Scott King Author Awards, and three National Book Award Finalists citations. In addition, he is the winner of the first Michael L. Printz Award. He lives in Jersey City, New Jersey.<br>Greg "Slam" Harris's life revolves around basketball. His game, which is formidable, is the only thing he has control over. Everything outside of the court is a struggle: His marks are slipping; the basketball coach in his new school benches him for his attitude; and he's afraid his friend, Ice, is dealing drugs. Myers's book reflects difficulties faced by young kids when their dreams are all they have to hold onto, and they're forced to grow up too soon. Thomas Penny's narration ably presents the voices of Slam's teachers, with their snide, preaching, and ultimately hopeful messages, and shines when Slam goes after his dream.

I will guide you through this program step by step, explaining the changes I will ask you to make in how you eat, how you exercise, how you breathe, and how you use your mind. I will recommend vitamins, minerals, and herbs you can use to protect your body's healing system, and I will give you ideas about how you can change long-standing patterns of behavior that impair optimal health.<br><br>The Eight-Week Program consists of small steps that build on each other until, but the time you complete it, you have laid the foundation for healthy living. You can then decide how much of the program you want to maintain on a permanent basis. I assume that you want to make changes in your life -- otherwise you wouldn't be reading this book. I see my job as pointing you in the right direction. I have no doubt that you can change, because I know from my own experience that people can do so if they really want to.<br><br>In moving files recently, I came across a yellowed clipping from <b>The New York Times</b> of August 12, 1971, with the headline: "Meat-Eating 230-Pound Doctor Is Now 175-Pound Vegetarian." The story concerns a twenty-nine-year old physician in rural Virginia who gave up animal foods except for dairy products, with a resultant increase in energy, well-being, and overall health. There is a photograph of the doctor in his kitchen preparing fresh corn. He has a full black beard, is wearing blue jeans and a work shirt, and looks content. Next to the picture is his recipe for a rich corn soup containing milk and butter, and another recipe for a barley-and-vegetable casserole that calls for a quarter-cup of peanut oil. According to the article, the doctor's interest in consciousness led him to experiment with yoga and meditation, and "since yoga calls for a vegetarian diet, he gave up meat 'in order to really do it right.' He has been a vegetarian ever since, to the amazement of his friends, who remember him as a voracious meat eater and a fat person while at Harvard ... In one year on his new diet he has reduced from 230 to 175 pounds. His recurring colds and allergies have vanished..."<br><br>My beard is no longer black, and I have not been able to maintain my weight at 175-pounds. I am still mostly vegetarian (I have eaten fish for the past 10 years), though now I don't make rich soups with milk and butter , use oil in such quantities, or ever cook with peanut oil. I think I am wiser with age and in general feel much happier now than I did when I was twenty-nine.<br><br>I will try to accomplish three things in the pages that follow. First, I want to try to share with you my vision of the body's healing system and encourage you to rely on it in all matters concerning your health. Second, I want to convince you of the importance of developing a healthy lifestyle and the possibility of doing so quickly and easily. Third, I want to give you very specific suggestions about those aspects of lifestyle I consider most important to health and healing. I know that I cannot motivate you to undertake the Eight-Week Program -- you must do that yourself -- but since you have read this far, I believe you are already interested in moving forward, and I will assume that you now want to know what moving forward entails and how to do it.</p><h2>The Gingerbread Man (A StoryPlay Book)</h2><p><b>StoryPlay Books is the smart way to read and play together!</b> StoryPlay Books offer fun ways to engage with little ones during story time and playtime with prompts and activities that everyone will love!

The annual publication listed hotels, restaurants, service stations, and other businesses willing to take Black customers, and in doing so let drivers navigate the US. Started by mailman Victor Hugo Green in 1936, by 1959 the acclaimed series was edited and published by Victor&#39;s wife Alma D. Green (Victor would die the following year.) The book provides a state-by-state and city-by-city listing of businesses, including advertisements from proprietors reaching out to Black customers. Some of these were long-running, storied establishments, like the Booker T. Washington Hotel in San Francisco, where in its lounge you might run into W.E.B. Du Bois, Nat King Cole, or the Harlem Globetrotters; others were nothing more than a spare room in private home, the AirBNB of its day. All of them made life under the harshness of Jim Crow a little more livable. The 1959 edition, with the gentle warning &#34;Carry your Green Book with you... you may need it&#34; on the cover and promising &#34;Assured Protection for the Negro Traveler&#34; inside, comes from a period when the guide wasn&#39;t running the travelogues and articles that augmented other years, and is basically wall-to-wall listings and ads, but for a one-page guide on &#34;How to Guard Your Home During the Vacation Season.&#34;Also available in About Comics facsimile editions: Green Book editions for 1940, 1947, 1949, 1954, 1957, 1962 and 1963-1964, as well as The Official California Negro Guide 1942-1943.</p><p></p><h2>Gracefully Grayson</h2><p><b>"Tenderly and courageously told, <i>Gracefully Grayson</i> is a small miracle of a book.

An American diplomat is surrounded by hundreds of Maasai people. A gift is about to be bestowed upon the American men, women, and children, and he is there to accept it. The gift is as unexpected as it is extraordinary. <br>A mere nine months have passed since the September 11 attacks, and hearts are raw as these legendary Maasai warriors offer their gift to a grieving people half a world away. Word of the gift will travel newswires around the globe, and for the heartsick American nation, the gift of fourteen cows emerges from the choking dust and darkness as a soft light of hope&#x2015;and friendship.<br>This <i>New York Times</i> best seller recounts the true story from Wilson Kimeli Naiyomah of a touching gift bestowed on the United States by a tribe of Maasai Warriors in the wake of the September 11th attacks. With the stunning paintings of Thomas Gonzalez, master storyteller Carmen Agra Deedy hits all the right notes in this elegant story of generosity that crosses boundaries, nations, and cultures.</p><p>Carmen Agra Deedy is a New York Times bestselling author and has been writing and traveling around the world telling stories for more than twenty years. Her books have received numerous awards and honors. Carmen has performed in many prestigious venues, but children are her favorite audience.

Grade 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;Kimeli Naiyomah returned home to his Maasai village from New York City with news of 9/11 terrorist attacks. His story prompted the villagers to give a heartfelt gift to help America heal. Deedy and Gonzalez bring Naiyomah's story to life with pithy prose and vibrant illustrations. Each block of text consists of a few short, elegant sentences: "A child asks if he has brought any stories. Kimeli nods. He has brought with him one story. It has burned a hole in his heart." The suspenseful pace is especially striking when surrounded by Gonzalez's exquisite colored pencil and pastel illustrations. The colors of Kenya explode off the page: rich blues, flaming oranges, fire-engine reds, and chocolate browns. Full-page spreads depict the Maasai people and their land so realistically as to be nearly lifelike. Gonzalez manages to break the fourth wall and draw readers in as real-time observers. The book's only flaw is the less-than-concrete ending: "...there is no nation so powerful it cannot be wounded, nor a people so small they cannot offer mighty comfort" is an important message, but not a particularly satisfying one for children. Fortunately, their questions will be answered by Naiyomah's endnote, and it provides a fitting conclusion to this breathtaking chronicle.&#x2014;<i>Rebecca Dash, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In fact, outspoken Daisy is a self-described Sherlock Holmes, and she appoints wallflower Hazel as her own personal Watson when they form their own (secret!) detective agency. The only problem? They have nothing to investigate.<br> <br>But that changes once Hazel discovers the body of their science teacher, Miss Bell&#x2014;and the body subsequently disappears. She and Daisy are certain a murder must have taken place, and they can think of more than one person with a motive.<br> <br>Determined to get to the bottom of the crime&#x2014;and to prove that it happened&#x2014;before the killer strikes again, Hazel and Daisy must hunt for evidence, spy on their suspects, and use all the cunning, scheming, and intuition they can muster.

Robin has been making up stories all her life. She spent her teenage years at boarding school, reading a lot of murder mysteries and hoping that she&#x2019;d get the chance to do some detecting herself (she didn&#x2019;t). She studied crime fiction in college and then worked in children&#x2019;s publishing. Robin now lives in London with her pet bearded dragon, Watson.Murder Is Bad Manners <br><br> <br>This is the first murder that the Wells &amp; Wong Detective Society has ever investigated, so it is a good thing Daisy bought me a new casebook. The last one was finished after we solved The Case of Lavinia&#x2019;s Missing Tie. The solution to that, of course, was that Clementine stole it in revenge for Lavinia punching her in the stomach during lacrosse, which was Lavinia&#x2019;s revenge for Clementine telling everyone Lavinia came from a broken home. I suspect the solution to this new case may be more complex.<br> <br>I suppose I ought to give some explanation of ourselves, in honor of the new casebook. Daisy Wells is the president of the Detective Society, and I, Hazel Wong, am its secretary. Daisy says that this makes her Sherlock Holmes, and me Watson. This is probably fair. After all, I am much too short to be the heroine of this story, and who ever heard of a Chinese Sherlock Holmes?<br> <br>That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s so funny that it was me who found Miss Bell&#x2019;s dead body. In fact, I think Daisy is still upset about it, though of course she pretends not to be. You see, Daisy is a heroine-like kind of person, and so it should be her that these things happen to.<br> <br>Look at Daisy and you think you know exactly the sort of person she is&#x2014;one of those dainty, absolutely English girls with blue eyes and golden hair; the kind who&#x2019;ll gallop across muddy fields in the rain clutching a hockey stick and then sit down and eat ten cinnamon rolls at tea. I, on the other hand, bulge all over like Bibendum the Michelin Man; my cheeks are moony-round and my hair and eyes are stubbornly dark brown.<br> <br>I arrived from Hong Kong partway through seventh grade, and even then, when we were all still shrimps (shrimps, for this new casebook, is what we call the little sixth- and seventh-grade girls), Daisy was already famous throughout Deepdean School. She rode horses, was part of the lacrosse team, and was a member of the Drama Club. The Big Girls, which is what we call the girls in the top grades, took notice of her, and by May the entire school knew that the head girl herself&#x2014;Deepdean&#x2019;s most important Big Girl&#x2014;had called Daisy a &#x201c;good sport.&#x201d;<br> <br>But that is only the outside of Daisy, the jolly-good-show part that everyone sees.

I didn&#x2019;t know the people in the action movies were <i>Mareekan</i>. &#x201c;They are huge, strong, white people,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They eat pork, drink wine, and have dogs in their houses.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>This sounded like the people I had seen in the movies. Whoever they were, the militias looked worried about their arrival. Many rebels started burying their guns; some fled Mogadishu. There was confusion and tension everywhere. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to see <i>Mareekans</i> land in Mogadishu! Hopefully they would look like actors in the movies and would spray bullets all over the militias.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>And so at midnight on December 9, the thunderous roar of Cobra helicopters and AC-130 gunships filled the air. From the ocean came the buzz of hovercrafts, unloading tanks and Marines onto the beach. Our house was close to the airport and the sea, so all these sounds woke me up right away. Through the bullet holes in our roof I could see the gleaming lights of the planes, accompanied by the roar of tanks along the roads. My mother, Hassan and Khadija were all up, even Nima.<br><br>I was eager to see the troops and the helicopters in the morning. At dawn Hassan and I, holding hands, walked down to the airport past streets that used to have sniper nests. There were lots of Somalis in the street, all of them headed the same way, towards the airport. As we got closer, the sounds of the Cobra attack helicopters became deafening. We joined a group of other excited Somalis, some standing on the walls, others on top of roofs, watching as big Chinook heavy-lift copters took off and landed. We could see warships in the distance on the blue ocean; everywhere around the airport, Marines in camouflage were taking positions and setting up gun posts.<br> Someone said the <i>Mareekans</i> had rounded up the rebels who were controlling the airport and seaport. The crowd got bigger and bigger, we shouted, laughed and cheered in excitement. Security perimeters had already set up, blocking entrances to the airport. The <i>Mareekan</i> flag was waving, stars and stripes. That&#x2019;s when it hit me: <i>I had seen that flag in movies!</i> These <i>Mareekans</i> were the movie people, and this was a real movie happening in front of us!<br><br>Commando must be here, I thought. This is it. This is the moment I had been waiting for, to meet Commando and watch him blow away all the militias! Helicopters dropped a shower of leaflets with photos and information about the troops. I picked up several of them. &#x201c;United Nations forces are here to assist in the international relief effort for the Somali people,&#x201d; it said in Somali. &#x201c;We are prepared to use force to protect the relief operation and our soldiers. We will not allow interference with food distribution or with our activities. We are here to help you.&#x201d; Because not so many Somalis could read, the leaflets also showed an illustration like a comic book of a U.S. soldier shaking hands with a Somali man under a palm tree, as a helicopter flew past. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to shake hands with Commando.<br><br>Everything was moving so quickly&#x2014;the tanks, the soldiers, the planes. We jostled for positions to watch the movie that was happening in front of us. Except there was no gunfire. I kept waiting for the battle to start, I wanted the Chinooks and Cobras to blast away at the rebels. But everything was peaceful. Then I remembered it&#x2019;s always like this in the movies. First you see all the heavy machines and helicopters gearing up for action, then the battle comes later. I wanted to see the militias face these troops, but the rebels I had known since we returned to Mogadishu were now walking around unarmed, acting like regular people. They didn&#x2019;t dare to face Commando.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>I watched all day as the Marines took positions, more and more of them coming. Two men in uniform waved to let us cross the airport runway up to the sand dunes, so we could watch as the hovercrafts brought more and more Marines from the sea. Humvees and tanks roamed noisily but never fired a shot. I was getting impatient for the battle to start. We watched as the troops pulled out their stuck Humvees from the sand dunes. Hassan and I grew bolder and edged close to the troops. I stood there with my mouth open, watching them drink from a water bottle and smile at us. I made a sign asking for water, and the white guy in uniform went into the Humvee and handed me a plastic bottle. Then we made eating signs with our hands to our mouths, and they handed us tasty marmalade, bread and butter. The Commando lookalikes even spoke to us in Somali, but all they could say was <i>&#x201c;Somali Siko!&#x201d;</i> Somali move back!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>One of the Marines threw a chocolate candy to me. I grabbed it and swallowed the whole thing. When I got home and told Mom, she gave me a hard slap.<br><br>&#x201c;You must not eat pork!&#x201d; she said.<br><br>I told her I didn&#x2019;t think it was pork, it was sweet, but she didn&#x2019;t believe me. How would she know what pork tastes like?<br><br>Night came again, and Mogadishu was noisier than I had ever heard it. But for the first time in two years, there was no sound of explosions and gunfire. We were surprised how the Marines lit up the airport. Lights came from everywhere, helicopters, tents, cars. It looked like daytime in the middle of the night. We were not allowed to get too close to the airport at night<i>&#x2014;&#x201c;Somali Siko!&#x201d;</i> the Marines yelled over and over. But for the first time my friends, my brother and I could go out on the dusty streets after dark and play games, laugh and talk. We counted the helicopters as they flew over, and the big gunships that circled over the city. Falis&#x2019;s movie theater could now stay open at night, but we did not go. For the first time in years, outside was even more exciting than the movies.<br><br>***<br><br>The year had changed to 1993, my ninth year of life. The U.S. troops and the star-spangled banner were now accompanied by blue UN helmets and flags of countries from all over Asia, Africa and Europe. Many non-military people also came to the city to help. We would see them jogging, and swimming in the green waters off the beach. One woman, some kind of aid worker, jogged every morning near our house. She was white, had long hair, and she smiled and remembered my name. I made sure to get up every morning and say hi to her when she passed. I watched her listening to music on her headphones and stretching. Sometimes she would sit and play games with me, my brother and Nima. She always brought us snacks like peanuts, candies and cookies, and she also brought painkillers, antibiotics and other medicine. We had never seen pills, so she explained what they were for, and how to take them. I think I fell in love with this women, it wasn&#x2019;t romantic but I just wanted to stay close to her. If I knew her name today, maybe I could find her in America, but I only called her what we called all non-Muslims, <i>gaalo</i> or infidel. One day she came to the <i>madrassa</i>, just to visit and say hi. Macalin Basbaas refused to shake her hand. Then one day we stopped seeing her. Soon we realized no one was jogging anymore.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>The warlords were getting restless, they wanted the city back. Aidid had a radio station and was telling Somalis on the air that they should fight the &#x201c;occupation&#x201d; of Mogadishu. On June 5, UN forces went to the radio station to seize weapons. Aidid thought they were trying to shut down the broadcasts and he ambushed the troops, killing twenty-four Pakistani soldiers. That&#x2019;s when things got bad. On July 12 the Americans sent Cobras over a house in Mogadishu where they thought Aidid was hiding and blasted it into rubble. He wasn&#x2019;t there, but dozens of other people were killed. Aidid claimed the Americans had killed women and children, and he started to whip up Somalis against the infidel &#x201c;invaders.&#x201d; The Americans said only Aidid&#x2019;s soldiers had been in the house, but the seed of resentment against the foreigners had been planted. Aidid wasted no time, planting roadside bombs in August that killed four American soldiers and wounded seven others. The Battle of Mogadishu had begun.<br><br>I had been waiting so long for this moment! I wanted to see the American troops in action and how they fight. Hassan and I were so excited for war, we ran toward whatever corner of the city we heard explosions or gunshots. Soon Cobras and Black Hawks were swooping down everywhere, hovering over buildings where militias were hiding. I looked up and cheered whenever the helicopters shot at a building, to me it seemed like the greatest movie. I stood on the streets and watched militias yell at each other, jumping from house to house and hiding in narrow alleys. We watched them take positions as helicopters hovered over them.<br><br> I thought the airplanes and helicopters would scare the militias away, but instead the huge, strong American men of the movies were being chased by Somali rebels on the streets. It was not what I expected. Soon everything had changed. We were no longer welcome near the Marines, there were no more candies or cookies. For the first time the Marines were aiming their guns at Somalis and pushing them around, even us kids. They looked nervous. <br><br> It is hard to explain why so many Mogadishans turned against the Marines and cheered the militias. The rebels had been killing us for four years, stealing our food and shitting in our houses. The Americans had been so kind. For sure it was partly the U.S. attack on the house that killed so many civilians. And at this point we were so familiar with death and destruction that this new battle seemed like a basketball game or a soccer match, it wasn&#x2019;t even real life. People filled the streets, rooting for their home team. I too fell in with the crowd. I yelled out to the militias to let them know which side the helicopter was coming from. I threw rocks at helicopters. I ran with the crowd, repeating their cheers: &#x201c;Up with Aidid! Down with America!&#x201d;<br><br>The battle continued for weeks. The foreign troops slowly withdrew to the airport. Militias loyal to Aidid ruled the ground, but the foreign troops ruled the skies with their helicopters. At night it was hard for the Somali militias to see, but the helicopters with their infrared lasers were able to fire at their targets. Every night from our house I watched militias changing positions, shooting at helicopters. For a few minutes it would be dead quiet, then the helicopter would swoop down again and fire back. I believed my mother&#x2019;s prayers saved us from the helicopter cannons but now I think it was the pilots&#x2019; precision.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>On Sunday October 3, Aidid&#x2019;s forces shot down two Black Hawk helicopters with Russian RPG bazookas. I heard the booming explosions and columns of smoke rising about a mile from our house. Naturally, I ran as fast as I could to watch this new action unfold. Everything was so dusty I could not see much or get very close. A crowd was dragging the bodies of dead Americans, and people said others were still alive, trapped. The rescue operation lasted until the next day. Sixteen Americans died and more than three hundred Somalis. A few days later I was playing hide and seek in the remains of one of the Black Hawks.<br> &nbsp;<br> Five months later the Americans left Mogadishu. It was March 1994, my tenth year. The skinny rebels with their ugly brown teeth had beaten back the movie-star Marines. The Americans and the UN troops left so fast they didn&#x2019;t even take their stuff. They left behind malfunctioning helicopters and vehicles, boots and uniforms. I joined a crowd that went to the same spot where the <i>Mareekans</i> had first invited us to watch them land on the beach in hovercrafts. This time we were looting the stuff they left behind, even the boxes of medicines, tablets, discarded syringes. We stuck the syringes into our hands for fun. We ate the tablets. Was it looting if they just left it? <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>The same militias whom we had cheered against the foreigners would soon turn on us again&#x2014;stealing our food and shooting at us for sport. I felt shame that I had cheered against the Americans, the people who came to help us from the country of my dreams. But I now realize that I was lost&#x2014;a nine-year-old boy caught between the teachings of Macalin Basbaas, my mother and her view on infidels, the American troops and their kindness and food, my love for my brave father and the glorious Somali basketball team, and the American movies I loved.<br><br>I stood on the beach, picking through the discarded camouflage uniforms with the American names sewn above the pockets. I held them up, hoping one would fit my skinny little body. My friends Mohammed, Bashi and Bocow laughed. I looked at them and scowled.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not Somali,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I am <i>Mareekan</i>. I was left behind by the Marines. And they will come for me soon.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Figuring</h2><p><i>Figuring</i> explores the complexities of love and the human search for truth and meaning through the interconnected lives of several historical figures across four centuries&#x2014;beginning with the astronomer Johannes Kepler, who discovered the laws of planetary motion, and ending with the marine biologist and author Rachel Carson, who catalyzed the environmental movement. <br><br>Stretching between these figures is a cast of artists, writers, and scientists&#x2014;mostly women, mostly queer&#x2014;whose public contribution have&nbsp;risen out of their unclassifiable and often heartbreaking private relationships to change the way we understand, experience, and appreciate the universe. Among them are the astronomer Maria Mitchell, who paved the way for women in science; the sculptor Harriet Hosmer, who did the same in art; the journalist and literary critic Margaret Fuller, who sparked the feminist movement; and the poet Emily Dickinson.<br><br>Emanating from these lives are larger questions about the measure of a good life and what it means to leave a lasting mark of betterment on an imperfect world: Are achievement and acclaim enough for happiness? Is genius? Is love? Weaving through the narrative is a set of peripheral figures&#x2014;Ralph Waldo Emerson, Charles Darwin, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Walt Whitman&#x2014;and a tapestry of themes spanning music, feminism, the history of science, the rise and decline of religion, and how the intersection of astronomy, poetry, and Transcendentalist philosophy fomented the environmental movement.</p><p><b>MARIA POPOVA</b> is a reader and a writer, and writes about what she reads on <i>Brain Pickings</i> (brainpickings.org), which is included in the Library of Congress's permanent digital archive of culturally valuable materials.

This veneer must have been what the conflu�ence of accidents and atoms known as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., saw through when he spoke of our &#x201c;inescapable network of mutu�ality,&#x201d; what Walt Whitman punctured when he wrote that &#x201c;every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>One autumn morning, as I read a dead poet&#x2019;s letters in my friend Wendy&#x2019;s backyard in San Francisco, I glimpse a fragment of that atomic mutuality. Midsentence, my peripheral vision&#x2014;that glory of instinct honed by millennia of evolution&#x2014;pulls me toward a mirac�ulous sight: a small, shimmering red leaf twirling in midair. It seems for a moment to be dancing its final descent. But no&#x2014;it remains sus�pended there, six feet above ground, orbiting an invisible center by an invisible force. For an instant I can see how such imperceptible causalities could drive the human mind to superstition, could impel medieval villagers to seek explanation in magic and witchcraft. But then I step closer and notice a fine spider&#x2019;s web glistening in the air above the leaf, conspiring with gravity in this spinning miracle.<br>&nbsp;<br>Neither the spider has planned for the leaf nor the leaf for the spider&#x2014;and yet there they are, an accidental pendulum propelled by the same forces that cradle the moons of Jupiter in orbit, animated into this ephemeral early-morning splendor by eternal cosmic laws impervious to beauty and indifferent to meaning, yet replete with both to the bewildered human consciousness beholding it.<br>&nbsp;<br>We spend our lives trying to discern where we end and the rest of the world begins. We snatch our freeze-frame of life from the simultaneity of existence by holding on to illusions of permanence, congruence, and linearity; of static selves and lives that unfold in sensical narratives. All the while, we mistake chance for choice, our labels and models of things for the things themselves, our records for our history. History is not what happened, but what survives the shipwrecks of judgment and chance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Some truths, like beauty, are best illuminated by the sidewise gleam of figuring, of meaning-making. In the course of our figuring, orbits intersect, often unbeknownst to the bodies they carry&#x2014;intersections mappable only from the distance of decades or centuries. Facts crosshatch with other facts to shade in the nuances of a larger truth&#x2014;not relativism, no, but the mightiest realism we have. We slice through the simultaneity by being everything at once: our first names and our last names, our loneliness and our society, our bold ambition and our blind hope, our unrequited and part-requited loves. Lives are lived in parallel and perpendicular, fath�omed nonlinearly, figured not in the straight graphs of &#x201c;biography&#x201d; but in many-sided, many-splendored diagrams. Lives interweave with other lives, and out of the tapestry arise hints at answers to questions that raze to the bone of life: What are the building blocks of character, of contentment, of lasting achievement? How does a person come into self-possession and sovereignty of mind against the tide of convention and unreasoning collectivism? Does genius suffice for happiness, does distinction, does love? Two Nobel Prizes don&#x2019;t seem to recompense the melancholy radiating from every photograph of the woman in the black laboratory dress. Is success a guarantee of fulfillment, or merely a promise as precarious as a marital vow? How, in this blink of existence bookended by nothing�ness, do we attain completeness of being?<br>&nbsp;<br>There are infinitely many kinds of beautiful lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>So much of the beauty, so much of what propels our pursuit of truth, stems from the invisible connections&#x2014;between ideas, between dis�ciplines, between the denizens of a particular time and a particu�lar place, between the interior world of each pioneer and the mark they leave on the cave walls of culture, between faint figures who pass each other in the nocturne before the torchlight of a revolution lights the new day, with little more than a half-nod of kinship and a match to change hands.</p><h2>Kensuke&#39;s Kingdom</h2><p><b>A spellbinding tale of survival and self-discovery from award-winning author Michael Morpurgo, who is poised for breakthrough U.S. success.</b><br><br>When Michael's father loses his job, he buys a boat and convinces Michael and his mother to sail around the world.

Learn more at michaelmorpurgo.org.Grade 4-8-This poignant adventure story begins in England in 1988 and ends halfway around the globe in a place that will change the 11-year-old protagonist forever. After losing his job, Michael's father surprises the family by purchasing a yacht in which they will sail around the world. In the first weeks at sea, Michael, his parents, and his dog, Stella, zigzag from England to Australia and across the Coral Sea, where Michael's reverie comes to a frightening end. In the middle of the night, he and Stella are swept overboard in a fierce storm, and he later awakens on an island beach. The island is a hostile jungle full of howling gibbons, voracious mosquitoes, and brutal heat, all of which challenge his ability to survive. Yet when he finds fresh water and food mysteriously laid out for him each morning, he realizes that he is not alone. He soon comes face-to-face with Kensuke, an old Japanese soldier who cautiously protects Michael in spite of the boy's dogged determination to build a bonfire that will signal potential rescuers, defying Kensuke's wish that the outside world never learn of his existence on the island. For nearly a year, the man and boy help each other, moving from an uneasy d&#x201a;tente to a deep friendship. What might have been just a gritty tale of survival evolves into a gentle parable about trust, compassion, love, and hope. This well-crafted story has all the thrills and intrigues of Gary Paulsen's Hatchet (Macmillan, 1986) and Theodore Taylor's The Cay (Avon, 1976), and it will resonate with the same audience.<br><i>William McLoughlin, Brookside School, Worthington, OH</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Real Love: The Art of Mindful Connection</h2><p><p>We all yearn for connection, yet often feel trapped by our sense of isolation, anger, envy, and other forms of aversion.

Then one night her mother persuades her to leave all her pacifiers outside her room for the 'Pacifier Fairy' to take - (in exchange for a special gift). Bea gets to meet the fairy, who shows her that it IS possible to give up pacifiers without shedding a single tear.</p> <p> After reading, children can follow the story at home by collecting up their pacifiers and leaving them outside their bedroom at night. Parents can then ensure that the &#x2018;Pacifier Fairy&#x2019; takes them off to Fairyland, leaving a special gift in their place!</p> <p>The book also includes some fun ideas to help stop children missing the pacifiers, in the days after they've gone.</p> <p>"I read this book to my pacifier-loving son.

The most fascinating among them take their place in this updated edition of <i>Dinosaurs&#x2014;The Grand Tour</i>; from <i>Aardonyx</i>, a lumbering beast that formed a link between two- and four-legged dinosaurs, to <i>Zuniceratops</i>, who boasted a deadly pair of horns.

Eva is a member of the Society of Equestrian Artists and she is currently working full time as a professional artist and illustrator. She lives in Shropshire.If you want to draw horses then I can recommend this book. It really is just about drawing - no words are required so there are none. There is a brief introduction to using the book and further tips, but after that it is up to you. Just like How To Draw Birds In Simple Steps (also reviewed on this site) I was impressed with the beautiful simplicity of this slender book, reminding me irresistibly of the old Walter Foster series I learnt to draw from. This breaks the horse down into some basic shapes, and then adds the details in two or more drawings. Every new stage shows the next part in color, and finally there is a pencil drawing and a colored study of the subject. There is a large range of horse poses to choose from including heads, galloping, rolling, rearing, jumping etc and a good range of horse breeds from the Przewalski to the Lipizzaner, Exmoor Pony to Bay Arab and everything in between.

The job is good enough for Jeremy, quiet and predictable, and it gets him out of the house, where he lives with his dad and where they both try to avoid missing Mom, who died six years ago in a carwreck. But when a local school teacher comes in to return her copy of <i>Targets&#x2015;</i>an old movie, starring Boris Karloff&#x2015;the transaction jolts Jeremy out of his routine. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something on it,&#x201d; she says as she leaves the store, though she doesn&#x2019;t elaborate.

As Jeremy and those around him are absorbed into tapes, they become part of another story&#x2015;one that unfolds years into the past and years into the future, part of an impossible search for something someone once lost that they would do anything to regain.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of February 2017:</strong> In Nevada, Iowa, in the late 90s, someone is splicing creepy home footage into the videocassettes rented from the Video Hut. You might be enjoying a Boris Karloff classic with some popcorn when the narrative is disconcertingly interrupted by a few moments of someone breathing heavily in the dark, or maybe something more sinister waits for viewers of <em>She&#x2019;s All That</em>. And despite obvious reservations, Jeremy, treading water as a clerk following his mother&#x2019;s sudden death years earlier, can&#x2019;t stop watching. A few of the clips seem to betray local landmarks, and what self-respecting meddling kid could resist checking it out? This may sound like the set-up for a good thriller, but <em>Universal Harvester</em> is much stranger than that. Darnielle &#x2013; whose unorthodox debut novel, <em>Wolf in White Van</em>, was nominated for the National Book Award &#x2013; has written an understated slow burn of a book, lean on plot but dense in mood and dread. Darnielle is more interested in what ferments in the dark corners of our universal experiences &#x2013; how we cope with loss and absence and the ways that they bend us, the peculiar ways we become bent. In fact, if ambiguity isn&#x2019;t your thing, you might look elsewhere. People might be filming unnerving things in dilapidated, farm country outbuildings, but the pat, <em>Psycho</em>-style explanation is not forthcoming. <em>Universal Harvester</em> is like a David Lynch adaptation of a Marilynne Robinson novel, where manicured grass is replaced by fields of corn, but the bugs squirming beneath are the same. <em>--Jon Foro, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>John Darnielle</b>&#x2019;s first novel, <i>Wolf in White Van</i>, was a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, National Book Award nominee, and a finalist for the <i>Los Angeles Times </i>Book Prize for first fiction, and widely hailed as one of the best novels of the year.

Really, I think of myself as the one and only Tudor princess, for my sister Mary is too young to do more than be brought in by her nurse at suppertime, and taken out again. I make sure Mary&#x2019;s nursemaids are quite clear that she is to be shown to our new sister-in-law, and then go. There is no profit in letting her sit up at the table, or gorge on crystallized plums. Rich things make her sick and if she gets tired she will bawl. She is only five years old, far too young for state occasions. Unlike me; I am all but twelve. I have to play my part in the wedding; it would not be complete without me. My lady grandmother, the king&#x2019;s mother, said so herself.<br> <br>Then she said something that I couldn&#x2019;t quite hear, but I know that the Scots lords will be watching me to see if I look strong and grown-up enough to be married at once. I am sure I am. Everyone says that I am a bonny girl, stocky as a Welsh pony, healthy as a milkmaid, fair, like my younger brother Harry, with big blue eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be next,&#x201d; she says to me with a smile. &#x201c;They say that one wedding begets another.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t have to travel as far as Princess Katherine,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come home on visits.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You will.&#x201d; My lady grandmother&#x2019;s promise makes it a certainty. &#x201c;You are marrying our neighbor, and you will make him our good friend and ally.&#x201d;<br> <br>Princess Katherine had to come all the way from Spain, miles and miles away. Since we are quarreling with France, she had to come by sea, and there were terrible storms and she was nearly wrecked. When I go to Scotland to marry the king, it will be a great procession from Westminster to Edinburgh of nearly four hundred miles. I shan&#x2019;t go by sea, I won&#x2019;t arrive sick and sopping wet, and I will come and go from my new home to London whenever I like. But Princess Katherine will never see her home again. They say she was crying when she first met my brother. I think that is ridiculous. And babyish as Mary.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shall I dance at the wedding?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;You and Harry shall dance together,&#x201d; my lady grandmother rules. &#x201c;After the Spanish princess and her ladies have shown us a Spanish dance. You can show her what an English princess can do.&#x201d; She smiles slyly. &#x201c;We shall see who is best.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me,&#x201d; I pray. Out loud I say: &#x201c;A basse danse?&#x201d; It is a slow grand grown-up dance which I do very well, actually more walking than dancing.<br> <br>&#x201c;A galliard.&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t argue; nobody argues with my lady grandmother. She decides what happens in every royal household, in every palace and castle; my lady mother the queen just agrees.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to rehearse,&#x201d; I say. I can make Harry practice by promising him that everyone will be watching. He loves to be the center of attention and is always winning races and competing at archery and doing tricks on his pony. He is as tall as me, though he is only ten years old, so we look well together if he doesn&#x2019;t play the fool. I want to show the Spanish princess that I am just as good as the daughter of Castile and Aragon. My mother and father are a Plantagenet and a Tudor. Those are grand enough names for anyone. Katherine needn&#x2019;t think that we are grateful for her coming. I, for one, don&#x2019;t particularly want another princess at court.<br> <br><br> <br>It is my lady mother who insists that Katherine visit us at Baynard&#x2019;s Castle before the wedding, and she is accompanied by her own court, who have come all the way from Spain&#x2014;at our expense, as my father remarks. They enter through the double doors like an invading army, their clothes, their speech, their headdresses completely unlike ours and, at the center of it all, beautifully gowned, is the girl that they call the &#x201c;infanta.&#x201d; This too is ridiculous, as she is fifteen and a princess, and I think that they are calling her &#x201c;baby.&#x201d; I glance across at Harry to see if he will giggle if I make a face and say &#x201c;ba-aby,&#x201d; which is how we tease Mary, but he is not looking at me. He is looking at her with goggle-eyes, as if he is seeing a new horse, or a piece of Italian armor, or something that he has set his heart on. I see his expression, and I realize that he is trying to fall in love with her, like a knight with a damsel in a story. Harry loves stories and ballads about impossible ladies in towers, or tied to rocks, or lost in woods, and somehow Katherine impressed him when he met her before her entry into London. Perhaps it was her ornate veiled litter, perhaps it was her learning, for she speaks three languages. I am so annoyed&#x2014;I wish he was close enough for me to pinch him. This is exactly why no one younger than me should play a part in royal occasions.<br> <br>She is not particularly beautiful. She is three years older than me but I am as tall as her. She has light brown hair with a copper tinge to it, only a little darker than mine. This is, of course, irritating: who wants to be compared to a sister-in-law? But I can hardly see it, for she wears a high headpiece and a thick concealing veil. She has blue eyes like mine too, but very fair eyebrows and lashes; obviously, she&#x2019;s not allowed to color them in like I do. She has pale creamy skin, which I suppose is admirable. She is tiny: tiny waist pinched in by tight lacing so she can hardly breathe, tiny feet with the most ridiculous shoes I have ever seen, gold-embroidered toes and gold laces. I don&#x2019;t think that my lady grandmother would let me wear gold laces. It would be vanity and worldly show. I am sure that the Spanish are very worldly. I am sure that she is.<br> <br>I make certain that my thoughts don&#x2019;t show on my face as I examine her. I think she is lucky to come here, lucky to be chosen by my father to marry my elder brother Arthur, lucky to have a sister-in-law like me, a mother-in-law like my mother and&#x2014;more than anything else&#x2014;a grandmother-in-law like Lady Margaret Beaufort, who will make very sure that Katherine does not exceed her place which has been appointed by God.<br> <br>She curtseys and kisses my lady mother and, after her, my lady grandmother. This is how it should be; but she will soon learn that she had better please my lady grandmother before anybody. Then my lady mother nods to me and I step forward, and the Spanish princess and I curtsey together at the same time, to exactly the same depth, and she steps forward and we kiss on one cheek and then the other. Her cheeks are warm and I see that she is blushing, her eyes filling with tears as if she is missing her real sisters. I show her my stern look, just like my father when someone is asking him for money. I am not going to fall in love with her for her blue eyes and pretty ways. She need not imagine she is going to come into our English court and make us look fat and stupid.<br> <br>She is not at all rebuffed; she looks right back at me. Born and raised in a competitive court with three sisters, she understands rivalry. Worse, she looks at me as if she finds my stern look to be not at all chilling, perhaps even a little comical. That is when I know that this is not a young woman like my ladies-in-waiting who has to be pleasant to me whatever I do, or like Mary, who has to do whatever I say. This young woman is an equal, she will consider me, she might even be critical. I say in French: &#x201c;You are welcome to England,&#x201d; and she replies in stilted English: &#x201c;I am pleased to greet my sister.&#x201d;<br> <br>My lady mother lays herself out to be kind to this, her first, daughter-in-law. They talk together in Latin and I cannot follow what they are saying so I sit beside my mother and look at Katherine&#x2019;s shoes with the gold laces. My mother calls for music, and Harry and I start a round, an English country song. We are very tuneful and the court takes up the chorus and it goes round and round until people start to giggle and lose their places. But Katherine does not laugh. She looks as if she is never silly and merry like Harry and me. She is overly formal, of course, being Spanish. But I note how she sits&#x2014;very still, and with her hands folded in her lap as if she were sitting for a portrait&#x2014;and I think: actually, that looks rather queenly. I think I will learn to sit like that.<br> <br>My sister Mary is brought in to make her curtsey, and Katherine makes herself ridiculous by going down on her knees so their faces are level and she can hear her childish whisper. Of course Mary cannot understand a word of either Latin or Spanish, but she puts her arms around Katherine&#x2019;s neck and kisses her and calls her &#x201c;thithter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am your sister,&#x201d; I correct her, giving her little hand a firm tug. &#x201c;This lady is your sister-in-law. Can you say sister-in-law?&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course, she can&#x2019;t. She lisps, and everyone laughs again and says how charming, and I say: &#x201c;Lady Mother, shouldn&#x2019;t Mary be in bed?&#x201d; Then everyone realizes how late it is and we all go out with bobbing torches to see Katherine leave, as if she were a queen crowned and not merely the youngest daughter of the King and Queen of Spain, and very lucky to marry into our family: the Tudors.<br> <br>She kisses everyone good night and when it is my turn, she puts her warm cheek to mine and says: &#x201c;Good night, Sister&#x201d; in that stupid accent, in her patronizing way. She draws back and sees my cross face and she gives a little ripple of laughter. &#x201c;Oho!&#x201d; she says, and pats my cheek as if my bad temper does not trouble her. This is a real princess, as naturally royal as my mother; this is the girl who will be Queen of England; and so I don&#x2019;t resent the pat, more like a caress. I find that I like her and dislike her, all together, all at once.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you will be kind to Katherine,&#x201d; my mother says to me as we come out of her private chapel after Prime the next morning.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not if she thinks she&#x2019;s going to come here and lord it over all of us,&#x201d; I say briskly. &#x201c;Not if she thinks she is going to act as if she is doing us a favor. Did you see her shoelaces?&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother laughs with genuine amusement. &#x201c;No, Margaret. I did not see her shoelaces, nor did I ask you for your opinion of her. I told you of my hope: that you will be kind to her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; I say, looking down at my missal with the jeweled cover. &#x201c;I hope that I am gracious to everyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She is far from her home and accustomed to a big family,&#x201d; my mother says. &#x201c;She will certainly need a friend, and you might enjoy the company of an older girl. I had lots of sisters at home when I was growing up, and I value them, more and more every year. You too might find that your women friends are your truest friends, your sisters are the keepers of your memories and hopes for the future.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She and Arthur will stay here?&#x201d; I ask. &#x201c;They will live with us?&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother rests her hand on my shoulder. &#x201c;I wish they could stay; but your father thinks they should go to Arthur&#x2019;s principality and live at Ludlow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does my lady grandmother think?&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother gives a little shrug. That means it has been decided. &#x201c;She says the Prince of Wales must govern Wales.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll still have me at home.&#x201d; I put my hand over hers to keep her beside me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll still be here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I count on you,&#x201d; she says reassuringly.<br> <br><br> <br>I have only one moment alone with my brother Arthur before the wedding. He walks with me in the long gallery. Below, we can hear the musicians striking up another dance, and the buzz of people drinking and chattering and laughing. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to bow so low to her,&#x201d; I say abruptly. &#x201c;Her father and mother are new-come to their thrones just like our father. She has nothing to be so very proud of. They&#x2019;re no better than us. They&#x2019;re not an ancient line.&#x201d;<br> <br>He flushes. &#x201c;You think her proud?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Without reason.&#x201d; I heard my grandmother say exactly this to my lady mother so I know it is right.<br> <br>But Arthur argues. &#x201c;Her parents conquered Spain and took it back from the Moors. They are the greatest crusaders in the world. Her mother is a queen militant. They have extraordinary wealth and own half of the unmapped world. Some grounds for pride there, surely?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s that, I suppose,&#x201d; I say begrudgingly. &#x201c;But we are Tudors.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We are,&#x201d; he agrees with a little laugh. &#x201c;But that doesn&#x2019;t impress everyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course it does,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Especially now . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Neither of us says any more; we are both aware that there are many heirs to the English throne, dozens of Plantagenet boys, our mother&#x2019;s kinsmen, still living at our court, or run away to exile. Father has killed my mother&#x2019;s cousins in battles, and destroyed more than one pretender: he executed our cousin Edward two years ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think her proud?&#x201d; he challenges me. &#x201c;Has she been rude to you?&#x201d;<br> <br>I spread my hands in the gesture of surrender that my mother makes when she is told that my lady grandmother has overruled her. &#x201c;Oh, she doesn&#x2019;t bother to talk to me, she has no interest in a mere sister. She is too busy being charming, especially to Father. Anyway, she can hardly speak English.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t she just shy? I know that I am.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why would she be shy? She&#x2019;s going to be married, isn&#x2019;t she? She&#x2019;s going to be Queen of England, isn&#x2019;t she? She&#x2019;s going to be your wife. Why would she be anything but completely delighted with herself?&#x201d;<br> <br>Arthur laughs and hugs me. &#x201c;D&#x2019;you think that there is nothing better in the world but to be Queen of England?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; I say simply. &#x201c;She should realize it and be grateful.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you will be Queen of Scotland,&#x201d; he points out. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s grand too. You have that to look forward to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I do, and I certainly won&#x2019;t ever be anxious and homesick or lonely.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;King James will be a lucky man to have such a contented bride.&#x201d;<br> <br>That is the closest I get to warning him that Katherine of Aragon is looking down her long Spanish nose at us. But I nickname her Katherine of Arrogant and Mary hears me say it, since she is everywhere, always eavesdropping on her elders and betters. She catches it up, and it makes me laugh every time I hear her and see my mother&#x2019;s quick frown and quiet correction.<br> <br><br> <br>The wedding passes off very brilliantly, arranged by my lady grandmother, of course, to show the world just how wealthy and grand we are now. Father has spent a fortune on a week of jousting and celebration and feasting, the fountains flow with wine, they roast oxen in Smithfield Market, and the people tear up the wedding carpet so that they can all have a little piece of Tudor glory on their sideboards. This is my first chance to see a royal wedding and I inspect the bride from the top of her beautiful white lace headdress, which they call a mantilla, to the heels of her embroidered shoes.<br> <br>She looks pretty, I cannot deny that, but there is no cause for everyone to behave as if she is a miracle of beauty. Her long hair is the color of gold and brass, and falls around her shoulders nearly to her waist. She is as dainty as a little picture, which makes me feel awkward, as if my feet and hands are too big. It would be petty and a sin to think badly of her because of this, but I admit to myself that it will be better for everyone when she conceives a son and a Tudor heir, disappears into confinement for months, and comes out fat.<br> <br>As soon as the feast is over, the double doors at the end of the hall open and a great float comes in, pulled by dancers in Tudor green. It is a huge castle, beautifully decorated with eight ladies inside, the princ...</p><h2>Stolen Children</h2><p>When Amy agreed to baby-sit Kendra Edgerton, she had no idea she was stepping into a kidnapping plot. Two men force the girls out of the house and into a cabin in the woods, where they create DVDs to send to the families, in hopes of a large ransom from Kendra&#39;s wealthy parents. Using her wits and imagination, Amy stealthily sends clues to the police through the DVDs, but time is working against her: She has one week until her captors decide to return Kendra and get rid of Amy.</p><p>Peg Kehret was born in Wisconsin, grew up in Minnesota, spent fourteen years in California, and now lives with her husband in Washington State. They have two grown children, four grandchildren, one dog, and one cat.<p>Peg's novels for children are regularly recommended by the American Library Association, the International Reading Association, and the Children's Book Council. She has won many state "young reader" or "children's choice" awards. Peg's characters are ordinary kids who find themselves in exciting situations and who use their wits to solve their problems. There is usually humor as well as suspense in her books. A long-time volunteer at The Humane Society, she often uses animals in her stories.</p><p>Before she began writing books for children, Peg published plays, short stories, articles, and two books for adults. She is a frequent speaker at conferences for librarians and teachers.</p><p>At the age of twelve, Peg had polio and was paralyzed from the neck down. Because she can remember that experience and her year of recovery so vividly, she finds it easy to write in the viewpoint of a twelve or thirteen year old. Most of her main characters are that age. Her autobiography, <b>Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio</b>, won the Golden Kite Award from the Society of Children's Book Writers &amp; Illustrators, and the PEN Center USA West Award for Children's Literature.</p><p>When she is not writing, Peg likes to watch baseball, bake cookies, and pump her old player piano.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;Amy, 14, is hired by rich Mrs. Edgerton to fill in for her regular nanny. What should have been an easy job, three-year-old Kendra being a peach to watch, turns into a terrifying experience when the two girls are kidnapped and taken to a remote cabin in the woods. The two kidnappers videotape them and send DVDs to the Edgertons to convince them to pay a ransom for Kendra. Amy realizes that the men have no intention of allowing her to leave. She begins to work subtle clues into each video, hoping her best friend will be able to decipher their meaning. Finally, one of her clues pays off and a break is made in the case. <i>Stolen Children</i> features an interesting story and a strong female character, but the language is sometimes stilted and Amy occasionally seems more mature than her years. This book would be a good addition to large collections, or libraries with patrons clamoring for realistic thrillers.&#x2014;<i>Jessica Miller, New Britain Public Library, CT</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Between explorations, she lives and works in Northern California and still gallops on horses.PreS-Gr 2-Clinton's latest picture book is an ode to 12 animal species in danger of extinction. Those familiar with her past works will recognize the format: a collection of factual blurbs rather than one long narrative. A spread is devoted to each animal, always accompanied by a short explanatory paragraph. The text may be sparse, but there is not one wasted word. Readers will enjoy engaging with fun facts and vocabulary for animal groups (an "embarrassment" of giant pandas or a "crash" of rhinos, for example). In addition to the informational paragraph, bullet points are included for each animal which state its endangerment status, the reason for that status, and its geographic location. Marino's gouache illustrations are accurate yet whimsical and convey the personality of each animal. This book will get a lot of traction as a science or social studies curriculum addition and does not need to be read in order to be useful as a learning tool. It will also be an appealing cover-to-cover read for animal lovers. Useful endnotes include an explanation of the human-made reasons some animals are in danger of disappearing, as well as action items for those who want to do more to save them.

Much to the concern of her adopted parents, she decides to join her uncles and male cousins on a sailing voyage from Connecticut across the Atlantic to England (and her grandfather Bompie) on a 45-foot sailboat. Not only does she want to make the trip, she feels she has to.</p><p> This perilous cross-Atlantic journey will make young readers feel the wind in their hair and the salt spray on their face.

Readers get another angle on her, too, as Cody keeps a log that alternates with hers.

Scott, who has previously created books on shelter dogs, raptors and nocturnal creatures, has assembled a simple and beautiful book of the visages of cows, pigs, sheep, chickens and more exotic animals (a yak, a miniature donkey, as Indian peafowl) that live on farms or as pets."<br>-Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette<br><br>"Photographer Scott (Raptors: Portraits of Birds of Prey), known for her portraits of dogs and wildlife, turns her attention to farm animals in this loving tribute. The elephant (or Jersey cow) in the room, of course, is how many of these species are used for food. Scott doesn't shy away from this topic, nor does she dwell on it. She chooses instead to focus on her subjects, all of whom were photographed under ideal circumstances-close to the humans they know and love, and at the sanctuary farms they call home. This allowed Scott to truly capture the confidence and regality of Henri, a Slate Heritage Breed turkey (favorite snacks: grapes and watermelon) who has assumed the role of caretaker for a flock of chickens; Marcia, a Nigerian Dwarf goat who loved (human) kids; and Buffalo Bill, a gentle, affectionate water buffalo being trained as a therapy animal for autistic children. Each entry begins with an overview of the breed's heritage and key characteristics (the donkey's famous stubbornness, for example, is actually a valuable self-preservation instinct) along with the individual animal's unique traits.

Just a typical fantasy, but for a girl raised in a religious&#x2014;and abusive&#x2014;family, a simple dream could be the first step toward eternal damnation. Now Pattyn Von Stratten has questions. Questions about God, and sex, and mostly love. Will she ever find it? Pattyn experiences the first stirrings of passion, but when her father catches her in a compromising position, events spiral out of control.<br> <br>Pattyn is sent to live with an aunt in the wilds of rural Nevada to find salvation and redemption. What she finds instead is love and acceptance, and for the first time she feels worthy of both&#x2014;until she realizes that her old demons will not let her go. Those demons lead Pattyn down a path to hell&#x2014;not to the place she learned about in sacrament meetings, but to an existence every bit as horrifying.<br> <br>In this gripping and masterful novel told in verse, Ellen Hopkins embarks on an emotional journey that ebbs and flows. From the highs of true love to the lows of loss and despair, Pattyn&#x2019;s story is utterly compelling.

Visit her at EllenHopkins.com and on Facebook, and follow her on Twitter at @EllenHopkinsLit.Grade 9 Up&#x2013;Once again the author of<i> Crank</i> (S &amp; S, 2004) has masterfully used verse to re-create the yearnings and emotions of a teenage girl trapped in tragic circumstances. Poems in varied formats captivate readers as they describe a teen's immobilizing fear of her abusive father, disgust with a church hierarchy that looks the other way, hope that new relationships can counteract despair, joy in the awakening of romance, and sorrow when demons ultimately prevail. Pattyn Von Stratten is the eldest of eight sisters in a stern Mormon household where women are relegated to servitude and silence. She has a glimpse of normal teenage life when Derek takes an interest in her, but her father stalks them in the desert and frightens him away. Unable to stifle her rage, Pattyn acts out as never before and is suspended from school. Sent to live with an aunt on a remote Nevada ranch, she meets Ethan and discovers forever love. Woven into the story of a teen's struggle to find her destiny is the story of her aunt's barrenness following government mismanagement of atomic testing and protests over nuclear waste disposal. Readers will become immersed in Pattyn's innermost thoughts as long-held secrets are revealed, her father's beatings take a toll on her mother and sister, and Pattyn surrenders to Ethan's love with predictable and disturbing consequences. Writing for mature teens, Hopkins creates compelling characters in horrific situations.<i>&#x2013;Kathy Lehman, Thomas Dale High School Library, Chester, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this classic tale, a woman is reunited with the man she has loved for years&#x2014;and must reveal the secret that will jeopardize her chance for happiness at last. <br><br>He arrived out of the blue&#x2014;a flesh-and-blood phantom from the past in a sports car as sleek and sexy as Law Kincaid himself. The world-famous astronaut was as devastatingly attractive as the first time Marnie Hibbs had laid eyes on him, seventeen years before. But she well knew the perils of falling for a ladies&#x2019; man like Law. And this time she had someone besides herself to protect. Law is determined to discover who is sending him anonymous letters claiming he&#x2019;d fathered a son he knows nothing about. Showing up at the Hibbs&#x2019;s return address from the letters seemed like a step in the right direction. Marnie swears she isn&#x2019;t the guilty party, but when Law meets her son, it&#x2019;s like a one-two punch to his solar plexus. The boy is nearly the spitting image of Law. Law can&#x2019;t remember sleeping with Marnie&#x2014;then again, he can&#x2019;t remember much about his crazy past. But there&#x2019;s more to it than that: Marnie claims the boy isn&#x2019;t biologically hers. <br><br>As the tension between them becomes unbearable and the attraction undeniable, Marnie is forced to reveal a long-held secret...one that might cause her to lose both the boy she loves more than anyone&#x2014;and the man she desires more than anything.</p><p>Sandra Brown is the author of more than fifty <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, with over seventy million copies of her books in print. She and her family divide their time between South Carolina and Texas.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>The Porsche crept along the street like a sleek black panther. Hugging the curb, its engine purred so deep and low it sounded like a predator's growl.<br><br>Marnie Hibbs was kneeling in the fertile soil of her flower bed, digging among the impatiens under the ligustrum bushes and cursing the little bugs that made three meals a day of them, when the sound of the car's motor attracted her attention. She glanced at it over her shoulder, then panicked as it came to a stop in front of her house.<br><br>"Lord, is it that late?" she muttered. Dropping her trowel, she stood up and brushed the clinging damp earth off her bare knees.<br><br>She reached up to push her dark bangs off her forehead before she realized that she still had on her heavy gardening gloves. Quickly she peeled them off and dropped them beside the trowel, all the while watching the driver get out of the sports car and start up her front walk.<br><br>Glancing at her wristwatch, she saw that she hadn't lost track of time. He was just very early for their appointment, and as a result, she wasn't going to make a very good first impression. Being hot, sweaty, and dirty was no way to meet a client. And she needed this commission badly.<br><br>Forcing a smile, she moved down the sidewalk to greet him, nervously trying to remember if she had left the house and studio reasonably neat when she decided to do an hour's worth of yard work. She had planned to tidy up before he arrived.<br><br>She might look like the devil, but she didn't want to appear intimidated. Self-confident friendliness was the only way to combat the disadvantage of having been caught looking her worst.<br><br>He was still several yards away from her when she greeted him. "Hello," she said with a bright smile. "Obviously we got our signals switched. I thought you weren't coming until later."<br><br>"I decided this diabolical game of yours had gone on long enough."<br><br>Marnie's sneakers skidded on the old concrete walk as she came to an abrupt halt. She tilted her head in stunned surprise. "I'm sorry, I--"<br><br>"Who the hell are you, lady?"<br><br>"Miss Hibbs. Who do you think?"<br><br>"Never heard of you. Just what the devil are you up to?"<br><br>"Up to?" She glanced around helplessly, as though the giant sycamores in her front yard might provide an answer to this bizarre interrogation.<br><br>"Why've you been sending me those letters?"<br><br>"Letters?"<br><br>He was clearly furious, and her lack of comprehension only seemed to make him angrier. He bore down on her like a hawk on a field mouse, until she had to bow her back to look up at him. The summer sun was behind him, casting him in silhouette.<br><br>He was blond, tall, trim, and dressed in casual slacks and a sport shirt--all stylish, impeccably so. He was wearing opaque aviator glasses, so she couldn't see his eyes, but if they were as belligerent as his expression and stance, she was better off not seeing them.<br><br>"I don't know what you're talking about."<br><br>"The letters, lady, the letters." He strained the words through a set of strong white teeth.<br><br>"What letters?"<br><br>"Don't play dumb."<br><br>"Are you sure you've got the right house?"<br><br>He took another step forward. "I've got the right house," he said in a voice that was little more than a snarl.<br><br>"Obviously you don't." She didn't like being put on the defensive, especially by someone she'd never met over something of which she was totally ignorant. "You're either crazy or drunk, but in any case, you're wrong. I'm not the person you're looking for and I demand that you leave my property. Now."<br><br>"You were expecting me. I could tell by the way you spoke to me."<br><br>"I thought you were the man from the advertising agency."<br><br>"Well, I'm not."<br><br>"Thank God." She would hate having to do business with someone this irrational and ill-tempered.<br><br>"You know damn well who I am," he said, peeling off the sunglasses.<br><br>Marnie sucked in a quick, sharp breath and fell back a step because she did indeed know who he was. She raised a hand to her chest in an attempt at keeping her jumping heart in place. "Law," she gasped.<br><br>"That's right. Law Kincaid. Just like you wrote it on the envelopes."<br><br>She was shocked to see him after all these years, standing only inches in front of her. This time he wasn't merely a familiar image in the newspaper or on her television screen. He was flesh and blood. The years had been kind to that flesh, improving his looks, not eroding them.<br><br>She wanted to stand and stare, but he was staring at her with unmitigated contempt and no recognition at all. "Let's go inside, Mr. Kincaid," she suggested softly.<br><br>Several of her neighbors, who had been taking advantage of the sunny weekend weather to do yard chores, had stopped moving, edging, and watering to gawk at the car and Miss Hibbs's visitor.<br>It wasn't out of the ordinary for a man to come to her house. Many of her clients were men and most of them consulted with her there. Generally they were stodgy executives in dark business suits. Few had deep tans, looked like movie stars, and drove such ostentatious cars.<br><br>This area of Houston wasn't glitzy like some of the newer neighborhoods. Most of the residents were middle-aged and drove sensible sedans. A Porsche on the block was a curious thing indeed. And to her neighbors' recollections, Marnie Hibbs had never engaged in a shouting match with anyone.<br><br>She turned on the squeaky rubber soles of her sneakers and led Law Kincaid up the sidewalk and through the front door of her house. Air-conditioning was a welcome respite from the humidity outside, but since she was damp with perspiration, the colder air chilled her. Or maybe it was her distinct awareness of the man behind her that was giving her goose bumps.<br><br>"This way."<br><br>She led him down a spacious hallway, the kind that could be found only in houses built before World War II, and toward the glassed-in back porch, which served as her studio. There she felt more at home, more at ease, and better able to deal with the astonishing reality that Law Kincaid had unexpectedly walked into her life again.<br><br>When she turned to face him, his arctic-blue eyes were darting around the studio. They connected with hers like magnets.<br><br>"Well?" he said tersely, placing his hands on his hips. He was obviously awaiting a full explanation for something Marnie was in the dark about herself.<br><br>"I don't know anything about any letters, Mr. Kincaid."<br><br>"They were mailed from this address."<br><br>"Then there's been a mistake at the post office."<br><br>"Unlikely. Not five times over the course of several weeks. Look, Mrs. uh . . . what was it again?"<br><br>"Hibbs. Miss Hibbs."<br><br>He gave her a swift, inquisitive once-over. "Miss Hibbs, I've been a bachelor for thirty-nine years. <br><br>"It's been a while since puberty. I don't remember every woman I've gone to bed with."<br><br>Her heart did another little dance number, and she took a quick, insufficient breath. "I've never been to bed with you."<br><br>He threw one hip slightly off-center and cocked his head arrogantly. "Then how is it that you claim to have mothered a son by me? A son I'd never even heard of until I got your first letter several weeks ago."<br><br>Marnie stared at him with speechless dismay. She could feel the color draining from her face. It felt like the world had been yanked from beneath her feet.<br><br>"I've never had a child. And I repeat, I never sent you a letter." She gestured at a chair. "Why don't you sit down?" She didn't offer him a seat out of courtesy or any concern for his comfort. She was afraid that if she didn't sit, and soon, her knees would buckle beneath her.<br><br>He thought about it for a moment, gnawing irritably on the corner of his lower lip before he moved to a rattan chair. He sat down on the very edge of the cushion, as though wanting to be ready to spring off it if the need arose.<br><br>Self-conscious of her muddy sneakers, ragged cutoffs, and ancient T-shirt, Marnie sat in the matching chair facing his. She sat straight, keeping her dirty knees together and clasping her hands nervously on the tops of her thighs.<br><br>She felt unclothed and vulnerable as his incisive eyes moved over her, taking in her face, her uncombed hair, her yard work attire, and her grubby knees.<br><br>"You recognized me." He shot the sentence at her like a missile.<br><br>"Anybody who watches TV or reads a newspaper would recognize you. You're the most popular astronaut since John Glenn."<br><br>"And therefore I'm a visible target for every nutcase who comes down the pike."<br><br>"I am not a nutcase!"<br><br>"Then why the hell have you been sending me those letters? That's not even an original idea, you know. I get several dozen a day."<br><br>"Congratulations."<br><br>"They're not all fan letters. Some are hate mail from the religious crazies who believe we're going where God never intended man to go. Some credit God with the Challenger accident--His punishment for our tampering with heaven or nonsense to that effect. I've had proposals of marriage and of other assorted liaisons of a prurient and/or perverted nature," he said dryly.<br><br>"How nice for you."<br><br>Ignoring her snide remark, he continued. "But your letters had a stroke of originality. You were the first one to claim that I was the father of your child."<br><br>"Don't you listen? I told you I've never had a child. How could you possibly be the father?"<br><br>"My point exactly, Miss Hibbs!" he shouted.<br><br>Marnie stood. So did he. He tracked her when she moved to her drafting table and needlessly began rearranging sketch pencils and paintbrushes in their various canisters.<br><br>"You were also the first one to threaten me with public exposure if I didn't do what you wanted me to."<br><br>She turned to find him very close. She could even feel the fabric of his trousers against her bare legs. "What possible threat could I pose to you? You're the fair-haired child of the space program, hailed as a hero. You held every American spellbound in front of his television set while you and a Russian cosmonaut shook hands over a peace treaty in space.<br><br>"There was a ticker-tape parade in honor of you and your crew in New York. You had dinner at the White House with the President and First Lady. Almost singlehandedly you've turned around public opinion on NASA, which certainly wasn't favorable after Challenger. Critics of manned space flight are being ridiculed after what you've done.<br><br>"To pit little ol' me against a celebrity giant like you, I would have to be crazy or stupid. I assure you that I'm neither."<br><br>"You called me Law."<br><br>After her lengthy speech, his four-word rebuttal came as an anticlimax that took her off guard. "What?"<br><br>"When you first recognized me, you called me Law."<br><br>"Which happens to be your name."<br><br>"But the average man on the street would address me as Colonel Kincaid, nothing as familiar as Law. Unless we'd known each other well before."<br><br>She sidestepped that. "What did these alleged letters demand from you?"<br><br>"Money first."<br><br>"Money?" she exclaimed. "How crass."<br><br>"Followed by public acknowledgment of my son."<br><br>Marnie eased herself from between him and the drafting table. His closeness was wreaking havoc on her ability to think clearly. She began shuffling through a stack of sketches left lying on one of her worktables. "I'm a very independent, self-reliant person. I would never ask you or anybody else for money."<br><br>"This is a nice neighborhood, a big house."<br><br>"My parents'."<br><br>"They live here with you?"<br><br>"No. My father is dead. My mother suffered a stroke several months ago and is in a rest home." She slapped down the stack of sketches and faced him. "I manage to support myself. What business of yours is any of this?"<br><br>"I think the victim ought to get to know his extortioner." Huskily he added, "In every way."<br>His eyes moved over her again. This time more slowly and analytically. She saw them pause in the vicinity of her breasts, which the damp T-shirt did little to conceal. She could feel her nipples projecting against the worn, soft cotton and tried unsuccessfully to convince herself that the response resulted from the air-conditioning, and not Law Kincaid's stare.<br><br>"I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me now," she said with affected haughtiness. "I'm expecting someone soon and I've got to clean up."<br><br>"Who are you expecting? The agency man?" At her startled expression, he said, "You mentioned him when I first got here."<br><br>"He has an appointment to look at my proposed sketches for a commission."<br><br>"You're an artist?"<br><br>"An illustrator."<br><br>"For whom?"<br><br>"For myself. I freelance."<br><br>"What project are you working on?"<br><br>"The cover of the Houston telephone directory."<br><br>His tawny eyebrows rose a fraction, impressed. "That's quite a commission."<br><br>"I haven't gotten it yet." Marnie could have bitten her tongue the minute the words were out. He was shrewd enough to catch the slip.<br><br>"It would be an important commission to you?"<br><br>"Of course. Now, if you'll--"<br><br>He caught her arm as she tried to go around him, headed for the front door. "It must get tough, living from one commission to the next while you maintain this house and pay your sick mother's medical bills."<br><br>"I do fine."<br><br>"But you're not rich."<br><br>"Not by a long shot."<br><br>"That's why you've been writing me these threatening letters, isn't it? To get money from me?"<br><br>"No. For the umpteenth time, I haven't ever written you a letter."<br><br>"Blackmail's a serious crime, Miss Hibbs."<br><br>"And a charge too ridiculous even to discuss. Now, please let go of my arm."<br><br>He wasn't hurting her. But his encircling fingers held her much too close to him. She was close enough to smell his sexy cologne and the minty freshness of his breath, close enough to see the dark centers of eyes that had sold more copies of Time than any other issue in history when they'd graced the front cover.<br><br>"You seem reasonably intelligent," he said.<br><br>"Should I take that as a compliment?"<br><br>"So why did you send anonymous letters to me, then put your return address on the envelope?"<br>She gave a soft, disbelieving laugh and shook her head. "I didn't. Or was that a trick question designed to trap me? Where are these letters? May I see them? Perhaps after I saw them I could offer an explanation."<br><br>"Do I look stupid? I wouldn't hand them over to you so you could destroy the evidence."<br><br>"Oh, for heaven's sake," she cried. Then, staring up into his stern face, she said, "You're really taking this seriously, aren't you?"<br><br>"At first I didn't. You were just one crank in hundreds. But after the fifth letter, when you got really nasty about pinning a paternity rap on me, I thought it was time to confront you."</p><h2>Who Was Lucille Ball?</h2><p><b>Who doesn't love Lucy? The legendary actress, producer, and comedian steps into the Who Was? spotlight.</b><br><br>Much like her hit TV show,&nbsp;<i>I Love Lucy,</i>&nbsp;Americans in the 1950s fell in love with Lucy. Born in New York in 1911, Lucille Ball was always a natural performer. She danced in the chorus of Broadway shows and acted in small parts in Hollywood movies. But Ball's true gift was comedy. She found a way to showcase her gifts in 1951 when CBS gave her the chance to star in a sitcom. She based the show on her life and called it&nbsp;<i>I Love Lucy.</i>&nbsp;Over sixty years later, it is still one of the most loved television shows of all time. Lucille Ball became the first woman to run a major television studio, Desilu, and her comedic genius has kept people laughing for generations.</p><p>Pamela Pollack and Meg Belviso are authors of several books in this series, including&nbsp;<i>Who Is George Lucas?&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Who Was Susan B. Anthony?</i><b>Who Was Lucille Ball?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In the spring of 1952, cities across America experienced a mysterious drop in the water pressure every week between 9:30 and 9:35 p.m. In New York City, it seemed impossible to get a taxi on a Monday night. All the cabbies were off duty. And in Chicago, a department store changed its business hours because it seemed like no one was shopping on Monday nights anymore.<br> &nbsp;<br> What was going on?<br> &nbsp;<br> It turned out that it was all related to a TV show! A half-hour comedy.<br> &nbsp;<br> On Monday nights, Americans from coast to coast rushed through their dinner. Kids finished their homework as fast as they could.<br> &nbsp;<br> By nine o&#x2019;clock everyone gathered in front of their televisions. And waited. In the 1950s, TVs took a while to warm up. Finally a big heart appeared against a satin background. The theme song of <i>I Love Lucy</i> began, and America was watching. It turned out that the viewers across the country were all waiting for the show to be over before using the bathroom. Toilets all flushing at the same time had caused the water pressure to drop throughout one city! No one wanted to miss a minute of Lucy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lucille Ball, the star of the show, was the most beloved woman on television. Whatever trouble she was in, Lucy could make it seem like the funniest thing anyone had ever seen. All over the country, people couldn&#x2019;t stop laughing.<br> &nbsp;<br> How did Lucille Ball become one of America&#x2019;s first big TV stars? It wasn&#x2019;t easy. She worked for years in Hollywood, making movies before she got a chance to show TV viewers how funny she could be. But she wasn&#x2019;t afraid of hard work. And she wasn&#x2019;t afraid to take a pie in the face or fill her pockets with eggs or her mouth with chocolates, all to make people laugh.<b> </b><i>I Love Lucy</i> was the name of her show, and how could you not?<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>Chapter 1: Lucyball</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lucille Desiree Ball was born in Jamestown, New York, on August 6, 1911. Although she always preferred Lucille, her family nicknamed her Lucyball, and the world came to know and love her as Lucy. Her father, Henry, worked for Bell Telephone, putting up phone lines all over the country, so he, Lucy, and Lucy&#x2019;s mother, Desiree, moved around a lot.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Lucy was three and her mother was pregnant, Henry died of typhoid fever. Lucy and her mother, who was known as &#x201c;DeDe,&#x201d; moved in with DeDe&#x2019;s parents, Frederick and Florabelle Hunt. The family lived in Celoron, New York, not far from Jamestown. There, Lucy&#x2019;s brother, Fred Ball, was born in 1915. Other relatives came to live at the house in Celoron, too, including Lucy&#x2019;s young cousin Cleo.<br> &nbsp;<br> Grandpa Fred took Lucy to the theater to see the live vaudeville shows in Jamestown on Saturdays and to the silent &#x201c;flickers&#x201d; (movies) shown outside in the park during the summer months.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even though she was still very young, Lucy was a responsible girl. After her grandmother died, she looked after her younger cousins. From the time she was ten, she took any odd job she could find. She sold hot dogs at the local boardwalk, and she worked at an ice-cream shop until she was fired for always forgetting to put the banana in the banana split.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time she was a teenager, Lucy was very independent. She was the first girl in town to bob&#x2014;or cut short&#x2014;her hair, which was very shocking in the early 1920s. She was a &#x201c;flapper&#x201d;&#x2014;a slang word for the rebellious young women who wore makeup and short skirts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lucy liked it when people in town talked about her. She loved the attention. What she really wanted was to be onstage like the performers in the vaudeville acts or in the flickers. There weren&#x2019;t a lot of ways to become famous in Celoron. So Lucy started to think about where else she might follow her dream. New York City wasn&#x2019;t that far away. Many of the theaters in America were right there on Broadway.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lucy had never really tried to act before. She couldn&#x2019;t sing or dance, but she thought she could learn. If she just worked hard enough, Lucy was sure she could become a star. And she had never been afraid of hard work.<br> &nbsp;<br> By age fifteen, Lucy had convinced her mother to let her attend acting school in New York City. Even though money was tight, DeDe agreed to pay for Lucy to go for a six-week trial period. Lucy did her best at the school, but her teachers didn&#x2019;t think she had any talent. At the end of the six weeks, the school sent Lucy home with a note telling DeDe that she was wasting her money. They said Lucy would never be an actress.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Lucy didn&#x2019;t care what the school thought. If they didn&#x2019;t want her, she would make it in New York on her own.</p><h2>Last Guardian, The-Artemis Fowl, Book 8</h2><p>Opal Koboi, the power-crazed pixie, is plotting to exterminate humankind and become fairy queen.

Part of Phaidon's excellent Themes and Movements series, it surveys three decades of a tumultuous history with a brief but inclusive essay, reproductions of works by 155 artists, and lengthy excerpts from groundbreaking texts by artists and theorists. The challenge posed by a movement that spans several artistic generations and includes many contentious players is ably met by essayist Peggy Phelan, professor of performance studies at New York University. She illuminates the intertwined workings of feminist politics and literary criticism, psychoanalysis, race and queer theory with clarity and a refreshing absence of doctrinaire pronouncements. <p> The illustrations are organized chronologically under sometimes quirky headings, beginning with "Too Much" (late-'60s performance pieces by such pioneering figures as Carolee Schneemann, Miriam Schapiro, Eva Hesse, Louise Bourgeois, and Yayoi Kusama). The final section, "Femmes de Si�cle," contains work from the '90s by Coco Fusco, Kara Walker, Mona Hatoum, Jenny Saville, and others exploring "collective memories ... and traumas." Essays range from the raw invective of Valerie Solanas's "Scum Manifesto" (1967) to the reasoned arguments of Adrian Piper's "The Triple Negation of Colored Women Artists" (1990). While some may argue that the book could be more inclusive--it deals overwhelmingly with women artists who exhibit in major Western cultural centers--it offers an unparalleled breadth of reference. Irked by the perfect bodies of many feminist artists who use nudity in their work, I was struck by the poignancy and honesty of Hannah Wilke--a glamorous figure in '70s and '80s performance art--who chose to memorialize her bald, bloated self in photographs months before her untimely death from cancer in 1993. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i></p>Helena Reckitt is chair of the Women&#39;s Art Library and a senior lecturer in curating at Goldsmiths, University of London.</p><h2>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Dangers to Humanity: AI, U.

We also hope, scientists and big tech take one step back and think to innovate AI, in a more responsible fashion using an algorithm that takes every possible angle into consideration, to safeguard life. We will discuss what type of risk management and the components of this algorithm in the book, as well as the cultural aspects of AI. This AI book is meant to safeguard humanities interest, and we hope it receives acceptance from all people, may you be liberal, conservative, religious, atheist, the government, media or just a scientist doing what you cherish.</p><p></p><h2>Sleep, Big Bear, Sleep!</h2><p>It&#x2019;s time for Big Bear to hibernate, so Old Man Winter keeps telling him: "Sleep, Big Bear, Sleep." But Big Bear doesn&#x2019;t hear very well. He thinks Old Man Winter has told him to drive a jeep, to sweep, and to leap. Big Bear just can&#x2019;t seem to hear what Old Man Winter is saying. Finally, Old Man Winter finds a noisy way to get Big Bear&#x2019;s attention. Cozy illustrations rendered in pencil and mixed media by Will Hillenbrand bring this bedtime story to a fitting conclusion.</p><p><p>Author Maureen Wright and her husband, Don, have three sons and a daughter-in-law. <em>Sleep, Big Bear, Sleep!</em> is Maureen's first picture book. Maureen and her family live in Athens, Pennsylvania, where bears occasionally lumber across their property. Maureen's second children's book is <em>Sneezy the Snowman</em>. A sequel to the Big Bear Book, <em>Sneeze, Big Bear, Sneeze!</em> will be released in the fall of 2011. Look for <em>Earth Day, Birthday!</em> &nbsp;to come out in the spring of 2012.</p> <p>Will Hillenbrand has illustrated many beloved picture books, including <em>Kiss the Cow </em>by Phyllis Root; <em>Smash! Mash! Crash! There Goes the Trash! </em>by Barbara Odanka; and <em>What a Treasure! </em>by Jane Hillenbrand. He also wrote and illustrated another Christmas story, <em>Asleep in the Stable. </em>Will enjoys visiting classrooms to talk about the creative process involved in making a picture book. He lives with his wife, Jane, and their son, Ian, in Terrace Park, Ohio.</p>PreSchool-Grade 1&#x2014;It is getting cold and time for hibernation, so Old Man Winter says, "'Sleep, Big Bear, sleep.'/But Big Bear didn't hear very well...." Instead he mishears Old Man Winter and, in attempting to follow his directions, drives a jeep, sweeps a house, climbs a steep mountain, etc. Ultimately, Old Man Winter yells loudly enough for Big Bear to understand him, and the bear heads off to his den for a much-deserved rest. The text moves at a steady clip, and the refrain will encourage child participation. The fact that "sleep" seems unlikely to be mistaken for "climb a mountain steep" or "drive a jeep" probably won't bother the intended audience. The story reads aloud well, and the limited text and oversize illustrations will be effective in storytime. The artwork is the real star here, though. Hillenbrand imbues his characters with motion and personality; their growing exhaustion is evident in their drooping eyes, ears, and body, and their startled expressions when Old Man Winter yells could not be clearer. An above-average addition for libraries looking for more bear, hibernation, or winter stories to freshen up interactive storytimes.&#x2014;<i>Amy Lilien-Harper, The Ferguson Library, Stamford, CT</i> END</p><h2>How Do I Feel?/�C�mo me siento?: Bilingual English-Spanish (Good Beginnings)</h2><p>This series of full-color board books, with both English and Spanish on each page, will intrigue youngsters while helping them build vocabulary and an awareness of the world around them.<br><br>The books feature charming illustrations and thoughtfully chosen words, offering an enchanting introduction to vocabulary.</p><p><b>Pamela Zagarenski </b>is the winner of two Caldecott Honors.

T. Wright for Everyone Bible Study Guides)</h2><p>For many Jewish Christians of the first century, living in the light of the gospel was challenging. Having accepted Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah, they were regarded by still-skeptical family, friends and neighbors as dangerous, misguided and even disloyal to all that God had said earlier on. The letter to the Hebrews was written to show that you can&#39;t go back to an earlier stage of God&#39;s purposes but must press on eagerly to the one that is yet to come. In these studies by Tom Wright we find encouragement and assurance that pressing on, even in the face of such close and constant pressure to fall back, is its own reward.</p><p><strong>N. T.

Build a shelter and play hide-and-seek. Pretend the woods are a jungle, or shout out loud to stir up the birds!

After studying visual arts in London, she went on to receive her degree in illustration at the Beaux-Arts Academy of Warsaw. She has written and illustrated three books, and her illustration clients include cultural and educational institutions. A Walk in the Forest is her first book to be translated into English. 2016 will see the publication of two more of Maria Dek's books in Poland, and one in France."A pale-skinned child crosses a blank, white page into a screen of trees, where "wonders await." Readers entering this book's varied landscape encounter similarly wondrous pictures and words. They stand in the child's shoes, enveloped by forest under a lush canopy of green leaves, looking skyward at brilliant birds darting from limb to limb. Verdant watercolor illustrations describe both the density and individuality of the myriad botanicals entwined in woods: fronds, leaves, branches, twigs, stems, grasses, and blossoms. Gentle imperative urgings pull readers into a lush, wooded embrace ("Run wild in the jungle!"; "Follow footprints. / See where they lead you"). Dek's evocative woodland pictures, earnest phrases, and unhurried pacing evoke the quiet pauses and exhilarating discoveries experienced during a walk in the forest. Inventive compositional choices and surprising, shifting perspectives keep readers alert, expectant, and fully engaged. They look from above in all-encompassing aerial illustrations; they burble underwater, examine nests, seeds, blossoms, and wild strawberries, gaze eye to eye with a fox, and survey upper branches from a bough. Deer and birds come and go across the page. Vines creep. Footprints meander. A breathless quiet falls on wordless spreads, conjuring that feeling of clearheadedness offered by nature. A startling, successful evocation of the natural world and an urgent entreaty for young people to immerse themselves in the outdoors.

Already fluent in English and French, she began writing short stories about growing up in her native Eastern Europe, at first as a cathartic experience as she transitioned to a new culture. Building on her love of the written language, she obtained a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in journalism from California State University, Northridge and has worked as an editor, content writer, and marketing manager for a number of Fortune 500 companies.The Girl They Left Behind 1<p></p> <br>Bucharest<br> <br>January 1941<br> <br>THE GIRL SITS ALONE IN impenetrable darkness. Shivering, she wraps her arms around her tiny body and buries her face in the collar of her wool cardigan. Out here on the building steps, she tries to remember exactly what her mother had told her. Did she say how long she&#x2019;d be gone? It was still light out when she last saw her parents rounding the corner, her mother with her shoulders slumped forward, trembling in her thin dress, her father shuffling down the frozen sidewalk just steps behind her. A chill tears through her as she places her palms on the icy concrete beneath her. The winter wind bites into her flesh, slashing mercilessly at her bare legs, and she wishes she had a blanket or mittens, or at least her bonnet, which somehow she has lost. Still, she&#x2019;d rather be out here in the frigid cold than inside that dark, musty lobby. The smell of cooked cabbage coming from one of the apartments made her stomach growl with hunger, even though at home she always refused to eat it no matter how much her mother pleaded with her.<br> <br>Drawing her knees to her chest, she looks up at the building&#x2019;s three stories and its vast, rounded balconies looming above. Certainly, she&#x2019;s never seen this building before. She has never seen this street, this vacant, dimly illuminated street on which a single lamppost casts a glint of light over the blackened snow. There isn&#x2019;t a person in sight. It is as if someone has turned out the lights on this once lively city, forbidding any strolling, greeting, or laughter.<br> <br>Her parents will be back any minute, she thinks, glancing up the length of the street again. She tries to recall her mother&#x2019;s soft voice telling her not to be afraid, that if she is a brave girl, all will be well. Still, she knows that she shouldn&#x2019;t be out at this hour. Just the other day, she overheard her parents talking about the curfew, how the Iron Guard were patrolling the city, arresting anyone still on the streets after sundown. How they&#x2019;d shot someone in front of their own building, right there for all the neighbors to see. She heard them talk about other things, too, things they didn&#x2019;t want her to hear, whispering in the room next to hers after she&#x2019;d long gone to bed. Their words were muffled, indistinguishable, but the desperate edge in their voices made her shudder in her warm bed.<br> <br>There are noises in the distance now&#x2014;shouting, shrieking voices intermingled with the rhythmic thumping of boots and windows slamming shut in the night. This has been happening for the last few nights, but this time, the sounds are accompanied by a strange smell, something like burnt coal but sickly sweet, which makes her stomach turn. Waves of nausea rise inside her, and she pulls the edge of her cardigan over her face to get relief from the stench, forcing her thoughts to her home and her bed with the pink satin quilt, the familiar light creeping through the door left ajar between their two bedrooms.<br> <br>Tears well up in her eyes, and she can no longer fight them. She is ashamed, because she knows she is not brave after all, even though she promised her mother that she would try her hardest. I will be good, Mama. I will be patient, she&#x2019;d said, but now those words seem as if they were spoken a lifetime ago.<br> <br>In the crook of her arm, her sobs spring free, knifing through the silence and echoing through courtyards and alleyways. Although she knows she should be quiet, there is no way to contain whatever it is that has come loose inside her. She cries until there is nothing left, until even her jagged sighs have melted away, becoming one with the wind. Lying down on the concrete landing, she curls herself up into a ball and finally lets herself slip into a bottomless chasm.<br> <br>Suddenly, sturdy arms embrace her, lifting her in the air. She is startled awake, and looking up, she sees the face of a woman she doesn&#x2019;t know&#x2014;hair pulled back in a silvery bun, random strands falling about her lined, rounded cheeks. The faint scent of starch and perspiration envelops her as the woman folds her against her chest, so tightly that she cannot break free, even though she tries with all her might, flailing her limbs. Yet there is something tender in the woman&#x2019;s grip, something comforting, and the girl is too cold and tired and weak, so she buries her face in the woman&#x2019;s bosom and begins to weep. Opening the entrance door with her elbow, the woman carries her back into the lobby. The girl wants to ask if she knows about her parents, if they are coming to get her soon, but when she opens her mouth, only a long, sharp wail escapes from her lips.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shh . . .&#x201d; whispers the woman in her ear. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got you. Shh . . . You are all right. You are all right.&#x201d;<br> <br>In the transient light of a passing car, the woman&#x2019;s face shines pale and wide like a moon visible amid passing clouds, her eyes like that, too, sparkling and moist. As if sensing the girl&#x2019;s gaze, they lower to hers, but an instant later, the light is gone, and they disappear from her again, sliding back into nothingness. Only the woman&#x2019;s arms remain, soft and solid all the same, and that scent encircling her in waves.<br> <br>&#x201c;Such a sweet thing,&#x201d; she thinks she can hear the woman murmur as if to herself in the returning darkness. &#x201c;Such a sweet little thing.&#x201d; There is a cluck of her tongue. &#x201c;What a pity.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>Twenty years she&#x2019;s worked as a concierge in this building. Twenty long years, during which she&#x2019;s gotten to know every family on the block, and so she can practically swear that this little girl does not belong to any of them. No, she is most certainly from a different part of town. Perhaps her parents were visiting someone in the building when the girl slipped away without their realizing. But who would let a child wander off in the middle of Dacia Boulevard? Who would leave a child of three, maybe four, in the middle of gunfire and the curfew and dead bodies lining the streets? In disbelief, in disgust, she shakes her head. She isn&#x2019;t the most educated woman, but she does know human decency, and she realizes this is an aberration.<br> <br>Even in her sleep, the poor thing is clutching her hand so tightly that she finds it impossible to move from the stairwell between the lobby and the first floor, where she&#x2019;s been cradling the girl in her lap. Just when she thinks she can try to lift her, the girl goes rigid, writhing and twisting, and all she can do is still her with her own failing body, folding over hers in a prayer. A prayer that she repeats again and again hours later, when she&#x2019;s managed at last to bring the child down to her basement room and the wavering light of a winter dawn trickles in through the sliver of glass that is her window.<br> <br>The girl wakes and sits up on the narrow bed. Her eyes roam unfocused about the tiny space, taking in the old dresser with its peeling lacquer, the kitchen half visible behind the threadbare curtain, the rusted soba in the corner in which a few sputtering flames leap like overgrown moths. Gathering the blanket closer around her, she scoots over to the far corner of the bed, but there is no fear on her face now, only confusion.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s my mama?&#x201d; she utters after a silence. Her voice is small, hardly audible. &#x201c;Is she coming to get me soon?&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman&#x2019;s hands are cold, so cold as she looks down at them, the way they keep rubbing each other as if they have a mind of their own. In the wood-burning stove, the embers flare and pop, and it is only when they&#x2019;ve turned completely to ash that she raises her eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, my sweet girl,&#x201d; is all she says simply. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><h2>Over the Edge of the World Updated Edition: Magellan&#39;s Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe</h2><p><p>The riveting story of Ferdinand Magellan&#x2019;s historic 60,000-mile ocean voyage&#x2014;now updated with a new introduction commemorating the 500th anniversary of his journey.</p><p><strong>&#x201c;Prodigious research, sure-footed prose and vivid descriptions make for a thoroughly satisfying account... it is all here in the wondrous detail, a first-rate historical page turner.&#x201d;&#x2014;&nbsp;<em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p><p>Ferdinand Magellan's daring circumnavigation of the globe in the sixteenth century was a three-year odyssey filled with sex, violence, and amazing adventure.

Every night, I slept in different places, sometimes on a hill, in a valley, or on top of a mountain. I found myself seeking and finding special places, and treasuring the times when I could feel deeply. In nature, I saw more moments that in my mind could not be possible, and yet they happened. I remember the uncertainty, the not knowing of what would be. But, at the same time, as my knowledge increased and gave power, it also limited me. Knowledge created a boundary that at times became the border of my life. It was only by questioning what I knew and in doing difficult things that I could grow. Here I learned my four treasured lessons: <br> </p><ol><li>Take care of those whom you love.</li> <li>Take care of your health.</li> <li>Do not limit yourself to what you know.

It has it all: remoteness, a fun adventurous hike, and thundering falls. Your adventure begins with a hike along the edge of the mile-wide, 350-foot-deep gorge that stretches across the landscape. After a quarter mile, the trail starts the descent down into the gorge, with a narrow path and a switchback to help make the steep hill easier to navigate. </p><p>The approach to the falls is from above and upstream, so you can see the progression of the 100-foot-wide Sturgeon River being squeezed through a narrow, volcanic outcropping that&#x2019;s only 25 feet wide. During my late-autumn visit, the river was low, but the sound and mist created by the falls was still impressive. (During the spring season, the falls are roaring!) You&#x2019;ll want to use extra caution hiking near the base of the falls, where the rocks and moss are wet and slippery. Beyond the falls, I also hiked downstream a short distance to take in the sight of the towering cliffs and hills across the river. </p><p>Because of the challenge and remoteness, I would recommend carrying a supply of snacks and food and only attempting this trek with a decent level of physical fitness.

She lives in North Carolina.<b>Helen Keller: The Mystery of Language</b><br>Helen Keller is best known as an activist for&nbsp;the rights of people with disabilities, but&nbsp;she was also a radical socialist who advocated&nbsp;for many oppressed groups. Before she could&nbsp;become such a strong force for social justice,&nbsp;she needed to acquire language&#x2014;no easy task&nbsp;for a deaf and blind child at a time when people&nbsp;with disabilities had little access to education.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Helen was born on June 27, 1880, in Tuscumbia, a&nbsp;small town in Alabama. She was a bright and confident&nbsp;toddler, but at only nineteen months old, she became&nbsp;very sick. The doctors thought she would die.&nbsp;Fortunately, Helen survived, but the illness left her&nbsp;unable to see and hear.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Helen spent a lot of time on her mother&#x2019;s lap or&nbsp;holding on to her skirt while she followed her around.&nbsp;She used gestures to make her wishes known, though&nbsp;she knew that other people moved their mouths to&nbsp;communicate. She would sometimes stand between two&nbsp;adults, touching their lips&#x2014;but when she tried moving&nbsp;her own lips, no one understood her.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Helen was five, her sister Mildred was born.&nbsp;Helen did not appreciate this new baby at all. Now&nbsp;Mildred sat on her mother&#x2019;s lap and took up a lot of her&nbsp;mother&#x2019;s time and attention.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a child, Helen liked to play with a little girl&nbsp;named Martha Washington, who was the daughter of&nbsp;the family&#x2019;s cook. Martha was two or three years older&nbsp;and she understood Helen&#x2019;s signs and gestures. Helen&nbsp;could be very bossy: she knew what she wanted and was&nbsp;prepared to fight to get it, so she usually got her way.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two girls spent a lot of time in the kitchen.&nbsp;They helped make ice cream, ground coffee beans,&nbsp;kneaded balls of dough, and fed the hens and turkeys&nbsp;that gathered around the kitchen steps. One time, a&nbsp;turkey stole a tomato from Helen&#x2019;s hand and ran off&nbsp;with it. That gave Helen and Martha an idea: the girls&nbsp;took a freshly iced cake from the kitchen, carried it to&nbsp;the woodpile, and ate the whole thing. Afterward, Helen&nbsp;was very sick.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Helen had fun with Martha, but she still had no&nbsp;language to communicate with. She often had angry&nbsp;outbursts and broke down in tears, frustrated and&nbsp;exhausted from trying to express herself. When she&nbsp;was six, her parents took her to Washington, D.C., to&nbsp;see Alexander Graham Bell&#x2014;the man who invented the&nbsp;telephone. He said that Helen could be educated and&nbsp;told them how to find a teacher.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Helen later described her teacher&#x2019;s arrival as the&nbsp;most important day of her life. Anne Sullivan was&nbsp;twenty years old, and she was determined to help Helen&nbsp;communicate. On their first morning together, Anne&nbsp;gave Helen a doll. Taking Helen&#x2019;s hand, she used the&nbsp;manual alphabet to fingerspell D-O-L-L into it.&nbsp;Curious about this new game, Helen spelled D-O-L-L&nbsp;back to her teacher. She was very pleased with herself&nbsp;and ran downstairs to show her mother her new signs.&nbsp;She was on her way to learning language, but she did&nbsp;not yet understand that this combination of signs meant&nbsp;&#x201c;doll,&#x201d; or that there was a word to go with every object.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Helen was sometimes annoyed by her new teacher&#x2019;s&nbsp;interference. &#x201c;She is very quick tempered and willful,&#x201d;&nbsp;Anne wrote in a letter soon after her arrival. But Anne&nbsp;was patient, persistent, and firm. Over and over, she&nbsp;spelled the names of everyday objects into Helen&#x2019;s hand.&nbsp;Helen quickly learned to spell the words back, but she&nbsp;was still just imitating her teacher.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A month after Anne&#x2019;s arrival, they had a breakthrough.&nbsp;Helen was holding her mug under the water&nbsp;spout while Anne pumped water to fill it; as the mug&nbsp;filled and cold water rushed over Helen&#x2019;s hand, Anne&nbsp;spelled W-A-T-E-R into Helen&#x2019;s free hand. Helen later&nbsp;described the moment in her memoir: &#x201c;Somehow the&nbsp;mystery of language was revealed to me. I knew then&nbsp;that W-A-T-E-R meant the wonderful cool something&nbsp;that was flowing over my hand. That living word&nbsp;awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free!&nbsp;There were barriers still, it is true, but barriers that&nbsp;could in time be swept away!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Helen needed more than individual words, however.&nbsp;She needed to be exposed to language in the way most&nbsp;children are: by being surrounded by it. So her teacher&nbsp;signed into her hands from morning to night, using full&nbsp;sentences, new words, unfamiliar expressions. Helen&nbsp;learned rapidly. She even tried to teach her new signs to&nbsp;her dog, Belle, by grabbing her paws and moving her toes!<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Helen worked so hard that her parents and Anne&nbsp;became worried. She fingerspelled constantly, not even&nbsp;wanting to stop to eat. They took her to a doctor who&nbsp;diagnosed her with &#x201c;an overactive mind.&#x201d; Anne tried to&nbsp;encourage Helen to slow down, but Helen was unstoppable.&nbsp;She began learning to read and write. She knew that&nbsp;Anne wrote letters in Braille to other blind children, and&nbsp;she began learning to write letters by herself.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One day, baby Mildred managed to grab one of&nbsp;Helen&#x2019;s letters. Helen pulled the soggy paper from her&nbsp;sister&#x2019;s mouth and gave Mildred a smack. Anne&nbsp;swooped in and picked up the crying baby. &#x201c;Wrong girl&nbsp;did eat letter,&#x201d; Helen told her, fingerspelling the words.&nbsp;&#x201c;Helen did slap very wrong girl.&#x201d; She said that she had&nbsp;told Mildred &#x201c;no, no, no many times.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne explained that Mildred did not understand&nbsp;Helen&#x2019;s signs, and that she needed to be gentle with the&nbsp;baby. Helen ran upstairs, and when she returned, she&nbsp;had a letter written in Braille. She gave it to Mildred.&nbsp;&#x201c;Baby not think,&#x201d; she told her. &#x201c;Helen will give baby&nbsp;pretty letter. Baby can eat all the words.&#x201d; It was the&nbsp;beginning of what eventually became a close&nbsp;relationship between the two sisters.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Helen was almost eight, she was invited to&nbsp;tour the Perkins Institution for the Blind, in Boston.&nbsp;Helen had been writing to the school&#x2019;s director Michael&nbsp;Anagos, and without her knowledge, he had been&nbsp;publishing her letters. Helen was becoming known&nbsp;throughout the country, but she wasn&#x2019;t yet aware of it.&nbsp;She enjoyed meeting other children at Perkins, and over&nbsp;the next few years, she was an unofficial student at the&nbsp;school. She was given access to a library of Braille&nbsp;books, and it was through this world of literature that&nbsp;she began to develop an awareness of human suffering.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Helen was eleven, she wrote a story called&nbsp;&#x201c;The Frost King&#x201d; and sent it to Mr. Aganos. He was&nbsp;impressed, but it soon became clear that the story was&nbsp;similar to one published several years earlier. Mr.&nbsp;Aganos accused Helen of plagiarism and had her&nbsp;questioned for two hours by a panel of judges. They&nbsp;eventually accepted that she had not intended to copy&nbsp;the story, which had been told to her when she was&nbsp;younger, but Helen was devastated. Soon after, she left&nbsp;the school. Her confidence was badly shaken, and for a&nbsp;while she was scared that her thoughts and words&nbsp;might not be her own. So Anne encouraged her to write&nbsp;about her own life. Helen&#x2019;s article began, &#x201c;Written&nbsp;wholly without help of any sort by a deaf and blind girl,&nbsp;twelve years old . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During her teens, Helen continued her studies with&nbsp;Anne. She learned to lip-read by placing her hand on&nbsp;the speaker&#x2019;s mouth and throat, and she also learned to&nbsp;speak. She went sailing in the summer and tobogganing&nbsp;in the winter. She loved to ride her horse and walk with&nbsp;her dogs. She met many well-known people, including&nbsp;the writer Mark Twain, who became a great friend and&nbsp;supporter.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was as a teenager that Helen began developing her&nbsp;ideas about social justice. Anne had grown up in great&nbsp;poverty. She took Helen to visit New York&#x2019;s Lower East&nbsp;Side, a poor area where many new immigrants lived.&nbsp;Helen was deeply moved. She found it hard to&nbsp;understand how wealthy people could bear to live in&nbsp;their &#x201c;fine houses&#x201d; while others struggled to survive.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At age twenty, Helen began her university studies at&nbsp;Radcliffe College, becoming the first deaf-blind person&nbsp;to earn a university degree. She joined the Socialist&nbsp;Party, writing letters and articles supporting the rights&nbsp;of workers and women and taking a stand against child&nbsp;labor. She supported the NAACP (National Association&nbsp;for the Advancement of Colored People), and she fought&nbsp;for the rights of deaf, blind, and disabled people. She&nbsp;became a peace activist as well. Helen visited thirty-five&nbsp;countries, giving lectures and reaching the hearts and&nbsp;minds of countless people around the world. In 1964, at&nbsp;age eighty-four, Helen Keller was awarded the&nbsp;Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of her&nbsp;contributions to her country.</p><h2>Ultimate Guide: Drywall, 3rd Edition (Creative Homeowner) Hang Drywall On Walls and Ceilings Like a Pro, Learn Taping Secrets for Seamless Joints, Apply Finishes and Make Drywall Repairs</h2><p><p><em>Ultimate Guide: Drywall, Third Edition</em>, will teach any reader to install and repair drywall with the confidence of a professional.

There&#39;s no time to take a helicopter ride for a close-up view - the hot air balloon races are about to start! Whisked up and away at the races, a surprised George gets a close-up view of the presidents after all. The adventures of Curious George continue in an all-new series beginning in fall 1998 with eight new stories. Written and illustrated in the style of Margret and H. A. Rey, the books will appear in paperback (8 x 8&#34;) and hardcover editions and will feature the art of Vipah Interactive, the animators of HMI&#39;s Curious George CD-ROMs.</p><p><p><b>Hans </b>and <b>Margret Rey </b>created many books during their lives together, including&nbsp;<i>Curious George</i>, one of the most treasured classics of all time, as well as other favorites like&nbsp;<i>Spotty&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Pretzel.</i>&nbsp;But it was their rambunctious little monkey who became an instantly recognizable icon. After the Reys escaped Paris by bicycle in 1940 carrying the manuscript for the original&nbsp;<i>Curious George</i>, the book was published in America in 1941. More than 200 Curious George titles followed, with 75 million books sold&nbsp;worldwide. Curious George has been successfully adapted into a major motion picture and an Emmy-winning television show on&nbsp;PBS.<br> &nbsp;</p><br><br>The Reys were born in Hamburg, Germany. <b>Hans Augusto Rey</b> (1898-1977) met his wife-to-be, <b>Margret</b> (1906-1996), at a party in her father&#x2019;s home in Germany; when he first caught a glimpse of her, she was sliding down the banister. In their twenties and thirties they lived in Paris and in Rio de Janeiro, where Hans sold bathtubs in villages along the Amazon River. Eventually Cambridge, Massachusetts, became the Reys&#x2019; home and community. Throughout their lives the Reys created many lively books together, including SPOTTY, PRETZEL, and lift-the-flap books such as HOW DO YOU GET THERE? The manuscript of the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and CURIOUS GEORGE was published in 1941. Their incorrigible little monkey has become an American icon, selling millions of books and capturing the hearts of readers everywhere. CURIOUS GEORGE has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian. Additional Curious George books followed, as well as such other favorites as CECILY G. AND THE NINE MONKEYS and FIND THE CONSTELLATIONS. Visit www.curiousgeorge.com.PreSchool-Grade 1-These two books take a familiar, favorite character and create an imitation of his curiosity, but without the Reys' usual spark and attention to detail. In Hot Air Balloon, George is playing with an anchor rope and the balloon takes off with him aboard. It blows quite close to the nose of George Washington at Mt. Rushmore where the monkey unwittingly rescues a worker and becomes a hero. He is rewarded with a helicopter ride around the monument. When Curious George Goes to a Movie, the man with the yellow hat leaves to get popcorn and George goes up to the projection booth where he startles the projectionist, who knocks the reels off the projector. While he untangles the film, George does shadow figures to amuse the audience and again becomes a hero. Both books read like anemic summaries of the original Curious George adventures, but with the lessons eliminated. It is disconcerting that this George never receives so much as a mention of the follies of his curiosity, but is immediately rewarded for a chance good deed, which happens as part of the cover-up for his naughtiness. Both the blandness and the mixed messages make these titles bad advertising for the real Curious George.<br><i>Nancy A.

The Uncomfortable Nearness of Strangers</b><br><br>September 1&#x2014;afternoon&nbsp;<br><br>Dear Isabel,&nbsp;<br><br>As a member of the family, you have a right to know what&#x2019;s going on. Dad agrees but says I should avoid &#x201c;topics of substance and despair.&#x201d; When I asked how he propose I do this, seeing as our family is prone to substantial desperation, he rolled his eyes and flared his nostrils, like he does. The thing is, I'm incapable of fluff, so here goes. The straight dope, Mim-style. Filled to the brim with &#x201c;topics of substance and despair.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Just over a month ago, I moved from the greener pastures of Ashland, Ohio, to the dried-up wastelands of Jackson, Mississippi, with Dad and Kathy. During that time, it's possible I&#x2019;ve gotten into some trouble at my new school. Not trouble with a capital T, you understand, but this is a subtle distinction for adults once they&#x2019;re determined to ruin a kid's youth. My new principal is just such a man. He scheduled a conference for ten a.m. this morning, in which the malfeasance of Mim Malone would be the only point of order. Kathy switched her day shift at Denny's so she could join Dad as a parental representative. I was in algebra II, watching Mr. Harrow carry on a romantic relationship with his polynomials, when my name echoed down the coral-painted hallways.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Mim Malone, please report to Principal Schwartz's office. Mim Malone to the principal's office.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>(Suffice it to say, I didn't want to go, but the Loudspeaker summoned, and the Student responded, and 'twas always thus.)&nbsp;<br><br>The foyer leading into the principal&#x2019;s office was dank, a suffocating decor of rusty maroons and browns. Inspirational posters were plastered around the room, boasting one-word encouragements and eagles soaring over purple mountains' majesty.&nbsp;<br><br>I threw up a little, swallowed it back down.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You can go on back,&#x201d; said a secretary without looking up. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re expecting you.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Beyond the secretary's desk, Principal Schwartz's heavy oak door was cracked open an inch. Nearing it, I heard low voices on the other side.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s her mother's name again?&#x201d; asked Schwartz, his timbre muffled by that lustrous seventies mustache, a holdover from the glory days no doubt.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Eve,&#x201d; said Dad.&nbsp;<br><br>Schwartz: &#x201c;Right, right. What a shame. Well, I hope Mim is grateful for your involvement, Kathy. Heaven knows she needs a mother figure right now.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Kathy: &#x201c;We all just want Eve to get better, you know? And she will. She&#x2019;ll beat this disease. Eve&#x2019;s a fighter.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Just outside the door, I stood frozen&#x2014;inside and out.&nbsp;<br><br>Disease?&nbsp;<br><br>Schwartz: (Sigh.) &#x201c;Does Mim know?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Dad: (Different kind of sigh.) &#x201c;No. The time just doesn't seem right. New school, new friends, lots of . . . new developments, as you can see.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Schwartz: (Chuckle.) &#x201c;Quite. Well, hopefully things will come together for Eve in . . . where did you say she was?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Dad: &#x201c;Cleveland. And thank you. We&#x2019;re hoping for the best.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>(Every great character, Iz, be it on page or screen, is multidimensional. The good guys aren&#x2019;t all good, the bad guys aren&#x2019;t all bad, and any character wholly one or the other shouldn&#x2019;t exist at all. Remember this when I describe the antics that follow, for though I am not a villain, I am not immune to villainy.)&nbsp;<br><br>Our Heroine turns from the oak door, calmly exits the office, the school, the grounds. She walks in a daze, trying to put the pieces together. Across the football field, athletic meatheads sneer, but she hears them not. Her trusty Goodwill shoes carry her down the crumbling sidewalk while she considers the three-week drought of letters and phone calls from her mother. Our Heroine takes the shortcut behind the Taco Hole, ignoring its beefy bouquet. She walks the lonely streets of her new neighborhood, rounds the skyscraping oak, and pauses for a moment in the shade of her new residence. She checks the mailbox&#x2014;empty. As always. Pulling out her phone, she dials her mother's number for the hundredth time, hears the same robotic lady for the hundredth time, is disheartened for the hundredth time.&nbsp;<br><br>We're sorry, this number has been disconnected.&nbsp;<br><br>She shuts her phone and looks up at this new house, a house bought for the low, low price of Everything She'd Ever Known to Be True. &#x201c;Glass and concrete and stone,&#x201d; she whispers, the chorus of one of her favorite songs. She smiles, pulls her hair back into a ponytail, and finishes the lyric. &#x201c;It is just a house, not a home.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Bursting through the front door, Our Heroine takes the steps three at a time. She ignores the new-house smell&#x2014;a strange combination of sanitizer, tacos, and pigheaded denial&#x2014;and sprints to her bedroom. Here, she repacks her trusty JanSport backpack with overnight provisions, a bottle of water, toiletries, extra clothes, meds, war paint, makeup remover, and a bag of potato chips. She dashes into her father and stepmother&#x2019;s bedroom and drops to her knees in front of the feminine dresser. Our Heroine reaches behind a neatly folded stack of Spanx in the bottom drawer and retrieves a coffee can labeled HILLS BROS. ORIGINAL BLEND. Popping the cap, she removes a thick wad of bills and counts by Andrew Jacksons to eight hundred eighty dollars. (Her evil stepmother had overestimated the secrecy of this hiding spot, for Our Heroine sees all.)&nbsp;<br><br>Adding the can of cash to her backpack, she bolts from her house-not-a-home, jogs a half-mile to the bus stop, and catches a metro line to the Jackson Greyhound terminal. She&#x2019;d known the where for a while now: Cleveland, Ohio, 947 miles away. But until today, she wasn&#x2019;t sure of the how or when.&nbsp;<br><br>The how: a bus. The when: pronto, posthaste, lickety-split. And . . . scene.&nbsp; But you&#x2019;re a true Malone, and as such, this won&#x2019;t be enough. You&#x2019;ll need more than just wheres, whens, and hows&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll need whys. You&#x2019;ll think Why wouldn&#x2019;t Our Heroine just (insert brilliant solution here)? The truth is, reasons are hard. I&#x2019;m standing on a whole stack of them right now, with barely a notion of how I got up here.&nbsp;<br><br>So maybe that&#x2019;s what this will be, Iz: my Book of Reasons. I&#x2019;ll explain the whys behind my whats, and you can see for yourself how my Reasons stack up. Consider that little clan- destine convo between Dad, Kathy, and Schwartz Reason #1. It&#x2019;s a long way to Cleveland, so I&#x2019;ll try and space the rest out, but for now, know this: my Reasons may be hard, but my Objectives are quite simple.&nbsp;<br><br>Get to Cleveland, get to Mom.&nbsp;<br><br>I salute myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I accept my mission.&nbsp;<br><br>Signing off,&nbsp;<br>Mary Iris Malone,&nbsp;<br>Mother-effing Mother-Saver</p><h2>To The Women I Once Loved</h2><p>&#x201c;TO THE WOMEN I ONCE LOVED&#x201d; is a reflection of a poet&#x2019;s heart, his inner feelings towards past relationships, and how they have contributed to the man he has become. Each piece brings consciousness to female attributes that ought to be glorified, and qualities men often neglect. While proving that who we become has a direct correlation to who we&#x2019;ve opened ourselves to, Pierre displays love and loss in a way that emanates hope.</p><p>Pierre Alex Jeanty, Founder of Gentlemenhood&#x2122; is a Haitian-American author, a poet and social media influencer who is devoted to making an impact through his writing. He primarily focuses on creatively sharing his journey, lessons and mistakes he made as he walked into manhood and into love. Pierre vows to share his wisdom to all in hopes to inspire men to become better. He also strives to be a voice of hope to women who have lost faith in good men. This is the vision of his brand and the agenda he follows as a writer. Pierre was born in Port-Aux-Prince, Haiti where he resided up until February of 2000. He moved to the United States of America in hopes of finding a better life. Pierre learned English through watching cartoons and attending ESOL classes in middle school. In high school Pierre excelled academically and athletically, being one of the best cross country and track runners during his years. He attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick Maine where he dropped out after his 2nd year at the Liberal Arts College. He then focused on networking online which gradually turned into him turning his passion to express himself and write into his career. Pierre is currently residing in southwest Florida as a Certified Life Coach and blogger aside from being an author and social media guru. His first book "Unspoken Feelings of a Gentleman" is still being recognized as a game changing piece of literature that is touching many hearts and minds and helping people better themselvesWhen you can pick up a book, read it and become filled with clarity on things not even directly said I consider it profound. That is exactly the kind of thing that will happen when you read the pages of this book. Even knowing that you re not one of the women Pierre once loved , you feel like pieces of them as he vividly describes their fears, their efforts, and their worth. The concept is genius because we all have feelings inside for the ones we once loved, but not many people take them and create something that can help inspire others; something that highlights our own flaws while highlighting the way another person s actions positively affected our lives. That alone is beautiful. So many women have touched the lives of men in some of these same ways but may never even know it. Poetry is sometimes placed into a box but this book allows you to see poetry in its many facets, in a transparent and beautiful way. I feel like the world needs more uplifting of women rather than tearing down. How can we create a better atmosphere for the next generation if we can t admit our mistakes and share what we have learned? Honestly this is a book you can read from front to back yet you still pick it up time after time to revisit the moments. You can feel the moments; you can feel the similarities in your own experiences. You can feel like the women who inspired each piece and the man telling the story. You understand that your encounters aren t foreign to others, just usually kept quiet and this book speaks. Once again Pierre has evoked emotion, given clarity, given hope, enlightened. --Curtrice Williams<br><br>I found myself more than once and over and over again as I read through the pages and so will you. The words written will represent you and will speak for you and in it you will find your voice and the words you are unable to express but can only think of. You will see your reflection and recognize your truth in a way that will encourage you to be more of who you are and what you stand for and less of what others think you should be. I appreciate such thoughtfulness written by Pierre and spoken in a way that I myself was able to say, that's me, I am her and I am glad that I truly value and know my worth. --Priscilla P. Williams<br><br>Mr. Jeanty finds a way to balance the joys and spoils of relationships and create a poetic tribute to the women he once loved. Each piece paints a picture prompting the reader to admire, question and reflect on --J.

"The Complete Confucius: The Analects, The Doctrine Of The Mean, and The Great Learning," brings together the most important Confucian texts with an introduction by Nicholas Tamblyn, and is part of The Essential Series by Golding Books.</p> <p>Confucius lived from 551&#x2013;479 BC. The principles he espoused largely reflected the values and traditions in China at the time. Rather than create a formal theory, Confucius desired that his disciples study, learning and mastering the classic older texts, and affirmed that the superior person seeks and loves learning for the sake of learning, and righteousness for the sake of righteousness.</p> <p>Confucianism is the cornerstone of Eastern philosophy and religion (and, similarly, Chinese and Asian philosophy and their subsequent vital influence on Western philosophy). It is a key part of religious studies and in developing an understanding of classical philosophy and its impact on modern philosophy. The sayings of Confucius (and discussions with his disciples) provide wisdom for those exploring religion and philosophy, but also in related areas such as spirituality, meditation, politics, and one's personal and public duties in society.</p> <p>A NOTE ON THE ANALECTS.&#x2014;The Analects are a compilation of speeches by and conversations between Confucius and his disciples. Believed to have been written during China's Warring States period (475 BC&#x2013;221 BC), and then finalized during the mid-Han dynasty (206 BC&#x2013;220 AD), it is a collection of sayings and ideas that have a foremost position in the history and study of philosophy across the world.</p> <p>A NOTE ON THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEAN.&#x2014;From The Book of Rites, this chapter known as The Doctrine of the Mean is attributed to Confucius' only grandson, Zisi (also known as Kong Ji). Its purpose is to show how the golden way is the means to gain perfect virtue, and that following the heavenly instructions of the Way will lead to the virtuous path trodden by others before, including Confucius. The phrase "doctrine of the mean" ("zh&#x14d;ng y&#x14d;ng") first occurs in Chapter 6 of The Analects; its definition is not expanded on there, but Zisi's text seeks to examine its meaning in greater detail.</p> <p>A NOTE ON THE GREAT LEARNING.&#x2014;Also one chapter in The Book of Rites, this writing is attributed to Confucius. In that book, his writing is accompanied by nine commentary chapters by his disciple Zeng Zi. The Great Learning explores, in beautiful and scriptural-sounding language, the linked themes of self-cultivation, enquiry and examination, and their impacts upon leadership and government. Each of the texts in this book&#x2014;with Mencius, the collected conversations of that scholar with various kings&#x2014;together comprise the four of the Four Books and Five Classics of Confucianism written in China before 300 BC.</p></p><p></p><h2>ABC for Me: ABC Yoga: Join us and the animals out in nature and learn some yoga!

Just like in her Emmy-nominated cooking show <i>Cooking with Julie Taboulie</i>, each of her recipes comes with hands-on instructions, tips, and tricks for making homemade Middle Eastern dishes using heaps of fresh, seasonal ingredients. Here you&#x2019;ll find dishes that range from classics like falafel, shawarma, and (of course) taboulie, to warming <i>Bazilla&#x2015;</i>a stew of tomato, green pea, and lamb&#x2015;to honey and rosewater-infused desserts. </p><p> In these 125 recipes, you&#x2019;ll learn how easy it is to make such Lebanese staples as fresh labneh (strained yogurt) and how to put together your own delicious, multi-purpose spice mixes. In addition to the delicious meat and chicken dishes, Lebanese cuisine offers a wide variety of vegetarian, pescatarian, vegan, and gluten-free dishes, usually with no substitutions whatsoever! Every chapter includes a multitude of dishes for eaters of all kinds and preferences, from meat-lovers to veggie-heads and everything in between.</p></p><p><p>JULIE ANN SAGEER is the host of the Emmy-nominated <i>Cooking with Julie Taboulie </i>and the upcoming <i>Julie Taboulie&#x2019;s Lebanese Kitchen, </i>airing on PBS stations nationwide. Born in Central New York and raised in the Finger Lakes, her warm, welcoming way in the kitchen lends a vibrant quality to the flavorful food she shares.</p><p>LEAH BHABHA graduated from Cornell and moved to San Francisco where she worked at Boulettes Larder. Following a year at <i>Food &amp; Wine</i>, she began her own website, <i>One Hungry Pickle</i>. She collaborated with Julie Ann Sageer on<i> Julie Taboulie's Lebanese Kitchen </i>cookbook.</p><p>"Julie Taboulie&#x2019;s passion for Lebanon and its rich cuisine is evident in her new cookbook. Her enthusiasm and attention to detail reaches the reader on every page -- you can almost smell the delicious food!" -Barbara Abdeni Massaad, author of <i>Man'oushe: Inside the Street Corner Lebanese Bakery</i></p><p>"Julie Taboulie's wonderful cookbook makes it easy to create vibrant, mouthwatering, made-from-scratch Lebanese dishes at home, without cutting any corners. Her recipes open up a whole new repertoire of Lebanese classics, even for those of us who grew up eating the cuisine at home. A must for anyone who loves Middle Eastern food, and for any 21st-century kitchen." -<br>Salma Abdelnour, author of Jasmine and Fire: A Bittersweet Year in Beirut</p><p>"I have been waiting for a while for Julie's cookbook ... and the wait was so worthwhile! This book brings into your home the luscious and exotic richness of Lebanese cuisine, along with its tips and tricks, in such an accessible and entertaining way. The photos, the stories and the recipes are all a gift to savor." -Pati Jinich, chef, author, and host of<i> Pati's Mexican Table</i> on PBS</p><p>"Sageer so loved her mother&#x2019;s lemony tabbouleh salad as a child in upstate New York that she earned the nickname &#x201c;Julie Taboulie,&#x201d; a moniker she uses on her PBS cooking shows. She evokes that memory and many others in this collection of recipes for Lebanese foods, from familiar hummus (presented with a handful of variations) to surprises such as panfried patties made with chickpeas, potatoes, and bulgur; a yogurt soup with lamb dumplings; and pickled baby eggplant stuffed with peppers. Sageer&#x2019;s outlook is encouraging, but occasionally she falters on logistics. A narrow-diameter dowel-style rolling pin is recommended or required or both, but she never explains why. There are two almost identical recipes for chicken shawarma, one with spices listed and another with a spice mix cross-referenced." &#x2015;Publisher's Weekly</p></p><h2>The Holy Bible: Douay-Rheims Version</h2><p>The Douay-Rheims Version of the Holy Bible, translated between the years 1582 and 1610 and revised by Bishop Richard Challoner from 1749-1752, is the most accurate English translation of the Bible available today. It was the only Catholic translation of Scripture commonly in use for over 200 years and we maintain that it is still the best and safest version of the Bible in English. Translated with profound respect for every word, the beautiful style of the Douay-Rheims Bible will instill in the reader a deeper understanding of the Word of God. Annotations, references and an historical and chronological index make it convenient for study as well as meditation.

In addition to the famous work of Dr. Frank Netter, you'll also find nearly 100 paintings by Dr. Carlos A. G. Machado, one of today's foremost medical illustrators. Together, these two uniquely talented physician-artists highlight the most clinically relevant views of the human body. In addition, more than 50 carefully selected radiologic images help bridge illustrated anatomy to living anatomy as seen in everyday practice.</p></p><p><p>Frank H. Netter was born in New York City in 1906. He studied art at the Art Students League and the National Academy of Design before entering medical school at New York University, where he received his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1931. During his student years, Dr. Netter's notebook sketches attracted the attention of the medical faculty and other physicians, allowing him to augment his income by illustrating articles and textbooks. He continued illustrating as a sideline after establishing a surgical practice in 1933, but he ultimately opted to give up his practice in favor of a full-time commitment to art. After service in the United States Army during World War II, Dr. Netter began his long collaboration with the CIBA Pharmaceutical Company (now Novartis Pharmaceuticals). This 45-year partnership resulted in the production of the extraordinary collection of medical art so familiar to physicians and other medical professionals worldwide. Icon Learning Systems acquired the Netter Collection in July 2000 and continued to update Dr. Netter's original paintings and to add newly commissioned paintings by artists trained in the style of Dr. Netter. In 2005, Elsevier Inc. purchased the Netter Collection and all publications from Icon Learning Systems. There are now over 50 publications featuring the art of Dr. Netter available through Elsevier Inc.</p> <p>Dr. Netter's works are among the finest examples of the use of illustration in the teaching of medical concepts. The 13-book Netter Collection of Medical Illustrations, which includes the greater part of the more than 20,000 paintings created by Dr. Netter, became and remains one of the most famous medical works ever published. The Netter Atlas of Human Anatomy, first published in 1989, presents the anatomic paintings from the Netter Collection. Now translated into 16 languages, it is the anatomy atlas of choice among medical and health professions students the world over.</p> <p>The Netter illustrations are appreciated not only for their aesthetic qualities, but, more importantly, for their intellectual content. As Dr. Netter wrote in 1949 "clarification of a subject is the aim and goal of illustration. No matter how beautifully painted, how delicately and subtly rendered a subject may be, it is of little value as a medical illustration if it does not serve to make clear some medical point.? Dr. Netter's planning, conception, point of view, and approach are what inform his paintings and what make them so intellectually valuable.</p> <p>Frank H. Netter, MD, physician and artist, died in 1991.</p></p><h2>Heidi Heckelbeck in Disguise (4)</h2><p><b>Heidi Heckelbeck is already a witch&#x2014;so what will she be for Halloween?

Visit her online at www.tess-sharpe.com. <br>Gr 9 Up&#x2014;The day Sophie is released from rehab starts the "now" of this story, which alternates with flashbacks from the past. Readers learn that the teen has had two close calls with death, the first in a crippling car crash with her friend Mina and Mina's brother Trev. The second was when Mina was murdered in front of her in what is assumed to be a drug deal gone bad. Because Sophie is a recovering drug addict, even her parents don't believe her when she says that the murder has nothing to do with drugs, hence her stay in rehab. Now that she's free, Sophie is obsessed with finding Mina's killer. Somehow she must overcome everyone's belief that her relapse caused Mina's death and enlist help in solving the crime. The mystery is a major theme of the book, and the author gives no clues before the revelation. This kind of plot twist is sometimes successful, but here the ending is so out of left field that it lacks believability. As readers follow Sophie's sleuthing, they learn that Mina was more than just her best friend; she was also her first love. This romance is full of struggle and strong emotions, likely to find an appreciable YA audience.&#x2014;Genevieve Feldman, San Francisco Public Library</p><h2>Thirty New Studies in Technics, Op. 849: Schirmer Library of Classics Volume 272 Piano Technique (Schirmer&#39;s Library of Musical Classics)</h2><p>A group of resourceful kids start &#34;solution-seekers.com,&#34; a website where &#34;cybervisitors&#34; can get answers to questions that trouble them.

Tinker orbits in the world of the wealthy; Katey and Eve stretch their few dollars out each evening on the town. While all three are complex characters, Katey is the story's shining star. She is a fully realized heroine, unique in her strong sense of self amidst her life's continual fluctuations. Towles' writing also paints an inviting picture of New York City, without forgetting its sharp edges. Reminiscent of Fitzgerald, <em>Rules of Civility</em> is full of delicious sentences you can sit back and savor (most appropriately with a martini or two). <em>--Caley Anderson</em> <br><br> <b>A sophisticated and entertaining debut novel about an irresistible young woman with an uncommon sense of purpose. </b> <br><br> Set in New York City in 1938, <i>Rules of Civility</i> tells the story of a watershed year in the life of an uncompromising twenty-five-year- old named Katey Kontent.

I am not a jazz historian, but for me the concert marks something of a turning point in jazz itself--from the big-band, swing-era sound that dominated the 1930s (and which the orchestra emphasized on stage that night) towards the more introspective, smaller group styles that would soon spawn bebop and its smoky aftereffects (ultimately reaching an apogee with Miles Davis&#x2019;s <i>Kind of Blue</i> in 1957). For it is also in 1938 that Coleman Hawkins recorded the bebop antecedent "Body &amp; Soul" and Minton&#x2019;s Playhouse, one of the key bebop gathering spots, opened in Harlem. By 1939, Blue Note Records was recording, and Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk were all congregating in New York City. From 1935-1939, Goodman himself was stepping out of the big-band limelight to make more intimate improvisational recordings with a quartet including Gene Krupa and Lionel Hampton.</p> <p>My assertion of this as a turning point (like most such assertions) is rough, inexact and misleading, but it helps give shape to an evolution and bring into relief two ends of a jazz spectrum. On the big-band front, the power of the music naturally springs from the collective and orchestration. In numbers like "Sing, Sing, Sing," the carefully layered, precisely timed waning and waxing of rhythm and instrumentation towards moments of unified musical ecstasy simply demand that the audience collaborate through dance, cheers, and other outward expressions of joy. While in the smaller groups of bebop and beyond, the expressive power springs more from the soloist and his personal exploration of the music, his instrument, and his emotional state at that precise moment in time. This inevitably inspires in the listener a cigarette, a scotch, and a little more introspection. In a sense, the two ends of this jazz spectrum are like the public/private paradox of Walker Evans&#x2019;s subway photographs (and of life in the metropolis itself.)</p> <p>If you are interested, I have created an playlist of music from roughly 1935-1945 that spans this transition. The playlist is not meant to be comprehensive or exact. Among other items, it includes swinging live performances from Goodman&#x2019;s Carnegie Hall Concert as well as examples of his smaller group work; there are precursors to bebop like Coleman Hawkins and some early Charlie Parker. As a strange historical footnote, there was a strike in 1942&#x2013;1944 by the American Federation of Musicians, during which no official recordings were made. As such, this period at the onset of bebop was virtually undocumented and thus the records of 1945 reflect something of a culmination of early bebop rather than its starting point. The playlist also reflects the influence of the great American songbook giants (Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, Irving Berlin, Rodgers &amp; Hart, the Gershwins), many of whom were at the height of their powers in the 1930s. <i>--Amor Towles</i></p> <p><b>Listen to the playlist</b></p>Born and raised in the Boston area,&nbsp;Amor Towles&nbsp;graduated from Yale College and received an MA in English from Stanford University.

This is the first step.<br><br>Featuring new and updated information and studies, including an introduction by actress Claudia Christian, the second edition of <i>The Cure for Alcoholism</i> delivers exactly what millions of alcoholics and families of alcoholics have been hoping for: a painless, dignified, and medically proven cure for their addiction. Backed by 82 clinical trials and research that extends back to 1964, The Sinclair Method deploys an opiate-blocking medication in a very specific way in combination with ongoing drinking to extinguish the addictive software&#x201d; in the brain. The de-addiction process rolls back the addictive mechanism in the brain to its original pre-addicted state <i>before</i> the first drink was consumed, making this program an actual cure for alcoholism.<br><br>Drs. Roy Eskapa and David Sinclair of The Sinclair Method have put together a sound scientific book that proves that with this particular method, alcoholism can be cured in more than 78 percent of patients. What&#x2019;s more, the treatment avoids the dangerous withdrawal symptoms, allowing patients to detox gradually and safely while they are still drinking.

Weaving together the multigenerational sagas of the industry's four wealthiest families, Burrough brings to life the men known in their day as the Big Four: Roy Cullen, H. L. Hunt, Clint Murchison, and Sid Richardson, all swaggering Texas oil tycoons who owned sprawling ranches and mingled with presidents and Hollywood stars. Seamlessly charting their collective rise and fall, <i>The Big Rich</i> is a hugely entertaining account that only a writer with Burrough's abilities-and Texas upbringing-could have written.</p><p><b>Bryan Burrough</b> is a special correspondent at <i>Vanity Fair </i>and the author of three previous books. A former reporter for the<i> Wall Street Journal</i>, he is a three-time winner of the John Hancock Award for excellence in financial journalism. Burrough lives in Summit, New Jersey, with his wife and their two sons.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Jonathan Yardley For me as doubtless for uncountable thousands of others, the image of oil-rich Texas was shaped for good by the second half of George Stevens's sprawling film "Giant" (1956), adapted from Edna Ferber's bestselling novel. Jett Rink, a charmingly loutish wildcatter played by James Dean, strikes oil on a tiny patch of land, builds it into a vast empire, transforms himself into the epitome of nouveau-riche vulgarity and, in the climactic scene, makes a drunken fool of himself before an audience of other arrivistes brought together to celebrate his spectacular wealth. As Bryan Burrough summarizes it in The Big Rich: "The mass media's discovery of ultrawealthy Texas oilmen in 1948, and the resulting caricature of flamboyant, jet-setting billionaires popularized in Giant, introduced the country to a new regional archetype -- funny, silly, harmless Texans who rode ostriches, wooed Hollywood stars, and scattered silver dollars on the sidewalks of Houston and Dallas like so much pocket lint. It was as if American had acquired an exotic new animal for the national zoo, Texas oilicus." The stereotype persisted for years, indeed is widely believed in to this day, though it has expanded to include "secretive oil billionaires plotting an ultraconservative takeover of America," the "alternately kooky and villainous portrayals of Texans in Dallas and movies such as Doctor Strangelove and Oliver Stone's JFK," Texas "millionaires who were seen as unlettered, uncouth know-it-alls," and "the Evil Texas Oilman" engineering assassinations and other vile deeds. Still more dimensions were added during the administration of Bush II, with gun-slinging cowpokes swaggering into foreign territories and vast conglomerates raking in the profits from these international adventures. Like most stereotypes, this one contains elements of truth as well as exaggeration and condescension. It is one of Burrough's aims in The Big Rich to separate truth from stereotype, a task he performs meticulously and occasionally amusingly. A native Texan, former Wall Street Journal reporter and co-author (with John Helyar) of Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, he is slightly defensive about his home state but sufficiently clear-eyed to recognize wretched excess when he sees it. His chronicle begins in the 1920s, when people started drilling for oil in Texas in a serious way; follows the development of the great oil fortunes through the ensuing four decades; then chronicles their decline "as their industry withered" and the Middle East became the greatest of all the world's gushers. It's a cautionary tale about the evanescence of wealth and glory, but it's also first-class entertainment. Burrough's focus is on four men who by the early 1930s had presided over one of "the greatest periods of wealth generation in American history, in size perhaps the largest creation of individual wealth between the Gilded Age and the Internet boom of the 1990s." He writes: "The fortunes forged during the Depression created a new top layer of Texas society, what came to be known in later years as the Big Rich. This was wealth on a scale entirely new to the state, and during the 1930s Hugh Roy Cullen, Clint Murchison, Sid Richardson and H.L. Hunt, soon to be known as the 'Big Four' oilmen, laid the foundations of a flamboyant lifestyle that would come to define the image of Texas oil. There were mansions to build, presidents to meet, European vacations to take, islands to buy, and children to raise." To say that all four men are now almost completely forgotten outside Texas would be an exaggeration, but not by much. Cullen, "a fifth-grade dropout who in his heyday was probably America's richest man," may be remembered beyond Houston "as an early champion of Texas ultraconservatism," but even that memory is fading rapidly. The root of Murchison's fortune was an "instinctive mastery of banking and lending practices [that] translated easily into an understanding of oil field drilling and geology," but he's chiefly remembered now as the original owner of the Dallas Cowboys. Richardson, who "at his death controlled more petroleum reserves than three major oil companies . . . left few footprints on history [and] attracted no biographer." Hunt, a bigamist, "a strange man, a loner who lived deep inside his own peculiar mind," was famous during his lifetime for extreme right-wing activities, but his name now means less than that of his universally well-liked son Lamar, a founder of the American Football League and engineer of its momentous merger with the National Football League. As Burrough says, "In the first years after World War II," these four "had emerged as a handful of the richest men in America -- and no one knew it. It wasn't just that few people understood how wealthy they were. Beyond the insular world of Texas oil, almost no one knew they existed." By 1948 "the Big Four had garnered precisely three references in the nation's newspaper of record, the New York Times." Then in that same year, Life and Fortune magazines published articles about the Big Rich that "triggered a seismic shift in the way America viewed Texas, especially its oilmen." The Big Four weren't especially eager to cooperate with the press, but in a fifth oilman, "many writers found exactly the kind of Texan they were looking for." Burrough continues: "The stereotype of the raw, hard-living, bourbon-swilling, fistfighting, cash-tossing, damn-the-torpedoes Texas oil millionaire did not exist before Glenn McCarthy rocketed into the national imagination in the late 1940s. Yet McCarthy was all that and more. Little remembered today, it was McCarthy, and his quixotic dreams, who, more than H.L. Hunt or Roy Cullen or his wealthier peers, introduced Americans to the changes oil had brought to Texas. The distilled essence of swaggering Texas id, McCarthy rubbed elbows with Howard Hughes and Hollywood stars, drank and brawled his way from Buffalo Bayou to Sunset Boulevard, and, at the peak of his fame, adorned the cover of Time. No Texas oilman ever rose so high or fell so hard." McCarthy, who was the model for Dean's Jett Rink character in "Giant," was, in the words of another oilman, "possibly the best practical oilman the country had produced, an improviser who could drill with junk [and who possessed] a knack for finding oil he couldn't explain because it came installed in his system like an antenna." He amassed a huge fortune in the 1940s, blew it, amassed another, blew that too. He built a great hotel in Houston and staged a garish opening party that was the model for the movie's climax, then gradually faded into obscurity, reappearing from time to time to refurbish his image as "the Lone Star playboy, the swinging oilman who romances starlets between trips on his airplane to see his next gusher." Eventually, though, he stayed away from the spotlight, and at his death in 1988 few remembered him. A considerably more lasting presence in American life has been big oil's "contribution to the growth of right-wing policies and politicians, especially in their most radical guises . . . bankrolling everything from mainstream Republican thinktanks to Senator Joseph McCarthy's red-baiting campaigns of the 1950s to extremist groups that openly espoused racism and anti-Semitism; later, oil money helped bankroll the birth of the religious right." Burrough argues that the explanation lies in "the deep-tissue insecurity of the nouveau riche. As one oilman told a magazine writer in 1954: 'We all made money fast. We were interested in nothing else. Then this Communist business suddenly burst upon us. Were we going to lose what we had gained?' " That's fine as far as it goes, but another explanation lies in the frontier mentality that has always characterized Texas and much of the West as well, the passionate belief in individualism combined with deep suspicion of government and any other large outside agency. In league with the "Southern strategy" that Richard Nixon employed to exploit racial fears in the Old South, Texas radicalism completely transformed the Republican Party, replacing Robert Taft and Everett Dirksen with Strom Thurmond and Tom DeLay. Whether this radicalized "base" will be able to continue its dominance of the GOP after the 2008 election remains unclear, but its influence on the country has been disproportionate to its actual size. The Texas oilmen who helped spawn it are long since gone, and their fortunes have been diminished for many reasons. Burrough is right to insist that they weren't quite the caricatures that Easterners found amusing or frightening, but his forthright, unsentimental book leaves little doubt that the caricatures had their roots in reality. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

"Read to your bunny often,/It's twenty minutes of fun./It's twenty minutes of moonlight,/And twenty minutes of sun." A final note again stresses the value of reading to children. While this message-laden story could have been overwhelming, Wells manages to steer clear of didacticism through her heartwarming illustrations. Each framed scene is a loving tribute both precise and precious and wholly satisfying in artistic presentation and integrity.

I heartily endorse this orientation of individual books to the whole Bible and the gospel, and I applaud the demonstration that sound theology was not something invented later by Christians, but is right there in the pages of Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy,</strong>&nbsp;Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;What a gift to earnest, Bible-loving, Bible-searching believers! The organization and structure of the Bible study format presented through the <em>Knowing the Bible</em> series is so well conceived. Students of the Word are led to understand the content of passages through perceptive, guided questions, and they are given rich insights and application all along the way in the brief but illuminating sections that conclude each study. What potential growth in depth and breadth of understanding these studies offer. One can only pray that vast numbers of believers will discover more of God and the beauty of his Word through these rich studies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bruce A. Ware,</strong>&nbsp;T.

Voices roll across the desert sands to Hoshmakaka, a curmudgeonly old camel, whispering that he has been chosen for the great responsibility of carrying gifts to the new baby king. With reluctance, Hoshmakaka accepts his task. Every day in the heat crossing the desert, his pack grows ever more burdensome as the crowds of people, anxious to welcome the new king, give him their gifts to carry. He is as strong as ten horses as he proudly tells the younger camels. But, oh, his gout! Oh, his sciatica! Nevertheless, Hoshmakaka plods on until he reaches Bethlehem. In the end he realizes the great honor of his task and never again is there a burden too heavy for him to carry.<br><br>Vlasta van Kampen's gorgeous illustrations of the hot desert sands and the cool, star-filled night sky transport readers on the journey to Bethlehem to see the new baby king. The beautifully detailed illustrations of the loveable Hoshmakaka masterfully change as his pack of gifts grows impossibly huge.<br><br>The endearing Hoshmakaka is also available as a plush toy to be a companion at storytime. Nine inches tall and adorned with his precious pack of gifts, Hoshmakaka will be a great reminder of the rewards of giving all year long!</p><p>Fredrick Thury served as Artistic Director of York University's Vanier College Productions for over twenty-five years. He was originally commissioned to write the story for THE LAST STRAW by the Toronto Children's Chorus, which performed the piece with musical accompaniment and subsequently recorded it for the CBC. Mr. Thury's works for children's theater include One Potato Too, The Technicolour Wizard, and Behind the Wrinkles.<br><br>Mr. Thury lived in Toronto. He passed away in 2006.A grumpy camel's boast comes back to haunt him in this engaging Christmas picture-book tale, adapted from a choral libretto. Despite gout, sciatica, and general surliness, old Hoshmakaka reluctantly agrees to carry the Wise Men's gifts to the baby king. But because he incautiously puffs himself up before the younger camels, he also ends up taking jugs of milk and wine, baskets of pastries, and other presents offered along the way. Vlasa van Kampen's bright, sharply detailed watercolors depict the shaggy protagonist plodding along in stately arrogance beneath a burden that grows to comically towering proportions. When a child asks him to carry a piece of straw, Hoshmakaka refuses. He relents, however, but he realizes that if he wants to finish his trek, he'd better not stop again. Entering the stable at last, the camel falls to his knees in exhaustion, whereupon a touch of the baby's hand dispels both the burden's weight and the camel's wounded pride. The text and illustrations work unusually well together to evoke the story's humorous undertone while preserving a grand sense of occasion. <i>John Peters</i></p><h2>Dragon Ball, Vol. 3</h2><p>With the Dragon Balls gone and Bulma&#39;s summer vacation over, Goku goes to the remote house of the Turtle Hermit, Kame-Sen&#39;nin, to be trained in the martial arts.

The assignment was a self-portrait in a favorite color. Nina had picked pink. Pink seemed like such an obvious girl color, Ada thought that Nina&#x2019;s choice might count against her. Ada&#x2019;s parents were big fans of going against &#x201c;gender norms.&#x201d; If Elliott, her little brother, had done the same assignment in blue, Mr. Lace probably would have told him to &#x201c;dig deeper.&#x201d;<br> <br>To Ada&#x2019;s surprise, Mr. Lace smiled and said, &#x201c;Really nice work, Nina. I love all the different tones you found in that color. You&#x2019;ve reinvented pink!&#x201d;<br> <br>Nina beamed. &#x201c;Thank you, Mr. Lace.&#x201d;<br> <br>It seemed like he must be in a good mood. Still, Ada was nervous. Maybe it was that her father had never sounded that excited about anything she had made in the past. The most she got was a &#x201c;Good job, sweetie&#x201d; and a pat on the head.<br> <br>As he handed the other kids&#x2019; pictures back, Ada listened to his praise. She tried to take it as a positive sign.<br> <br>&#x201c;Very nice contrast, Ethan. I can really see the details.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I love what you&#x2019;ve done with the ponytail, Pixie. Good texture.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Look at those eyes, Casey. Brilliant!&#x201d;<br> <br>So, it was a surprise when Mr. Lace slowed near Ada&#x2019;s seat and placed her picture facedown in front of her. His mouth flattened into something that was almost a smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ada,&#x201d; he said. And nothing else.<br> <br>Ada turned over her picture. There was a note that read See me next to a check mark.<br> <br> <br> <br>Ada looked at her self-portrait. She had tried to draw a picture of herself&#x2014;she really had. But it ended up looking like a sheepdog rather than a girl with floppy bangs. So instead she had drawn what was in her head: equations for Newton&#x2019;s second law, Einstein&#x2019;s mass-energy equation, and the Pythagorean theorem. She had thrown in some of her favorite constellations for good measure. The color she used wasn&#x2019;t like anyone else&#x2019;s, and she had added a little glitter to make certain details stand out. It had taken her a lot of time and effort, and she was pleased with the result. It revealed a side of her no one had seen before, which was, after all, one of the rules of the assignment. What could her dad&#x2014;her art teacher&#x2014;possibly have to talk to her about? She could barely pay attention the rest of the class. They were drawing cubes, cylinders, and spheres. She drew the cube over and over again and never moved on to the other forms.<br> <br> <br> <br>Nina ran up to her the second the bell rang.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gosh, your father is a good teacher. I&#x2019;m having THE BEST TIME in his class. He&#x2019;s so encouraging!&#x201d; said Nina.<br> <br>&#x201c;Heh, yeah! He&#x2019;s a real cheerleader,&#x201d; said Ada.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t just mean the grade. The grade barely matters! I&#x2019;m sure everyone got a check plus,&#x201d; said Nina.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; said Ada. &#x201c;Who wouldn&#x2019;t get a check plus?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He just knows what to say,&#x201d; said Nina. &#x201c;I was so nervous about choosing pink. But it really is my favorite color. And it turned out it was fine! It&#x2019;s just what you do with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; said Ada. &#x201c;Nina, can I meet you at lunch? I have to talk to Mr. Lace.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure. Hee-hee! It&#x2019;s so funny to hear you call him that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nina scooped up her stuff and bounced out of the classroom. Ada approached her father&#x2019;s desk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Adita,&#x201d; said Mr. Lace.<br> <br>&#x201c;If I have to call you Mr. Lace, Mr. Lace, I think you have to call me Ada.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You got it, kiddo,&#x201d; said Mr. Lace. But clearly he didn&#x2019;t get it, Ada thought, because he just replaced one pet name for another.<br> <br>&#x201c;You said I should &#x2018;see you,&#x2019; so I&#x2019;m seeing you. See?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I do see,&#x201d; said Mr. Lace. He clasped his hands together.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know I&#x2019;m not the best artist. I&#x2019;m not like you and Mom. But I&#x2019;m trying.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, sweetheart. And your work was fine. But it wasn&#x2019;t exactly what I assigned, now, was it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; Ada said. &#x201c;That was my self-portrait.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Heh! That&#x2019;s funny. It doesn&#x2019;t look like you!&#x201d; Mr. Lace chuckled. &#x201c;Are these spheres your ears?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my mind,&#x201d; said Ada. &#x201c;I was being creative! Isn&#x2019;t that what you&#x2019;re supposed to do in art class?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, yes. But sometimes we need guidelines to really challenge our creativity. And the brown is a little dark.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s burnt umber!&#x201d; said Ada. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing. It&#x2019;s unusual, but unusual is fine&#x2014;great even! It&#x2019;s mostly that you didn&#x2019;t try to draw a picture of yourself. If you had at least tried to show us your face, or profile, or even your left eye, I wouldn&#x2019;t even mention the brown.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Burnt umber,&#x201d; Ada mumbled.<br> <br>Mr. Lace took a breath. He let it out his nose. Ada saw a little bit of dry snot pop out and settle just outside his nostril. She thought about telling him, but changed her mind.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, Ada. But the point is not the color. It&#x2019;s the assignment. I will always be your father, but now I&#x2019;m your teacher, too. You can&#x2019;t just change the assignment as if this were an exercise we were doing together at home. Let me teach you. I give you guidelines to follow for a reason. Okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you say so, Mr. Lace,&#x201d; said Ada.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good. I&#x2019;ll see you after school.&#x201d;</p><h2>Guts &amp; Glory: The Vikings (Guts &amp; Glory, 2)</h2><p><b>History comes alive for kids like no textbook can in this epic account of the time of the Vikings that's perfect for history buffs and reluctant readers!

Wiccans understand that individuals can actually co-create with the forces of nature by linking their own personal energy with the divine through ritual and magic. But what is &#x201c;the divine&#x201d; when it comes to Wicca? Who are the Goddess and the God, and where did they come from? Why do they have different names in different Wiccan traditions, and how do you begin to work with them in your personal practice?<br><br><em>Magical Deities</em>, by best-selling author Lisa Chamberlain, answers these questions and more. Going beyond the usual brief introduction to the God and Goddess found in many beginner guides to Wicca, Lisa covers the origins of the Wiccan deities, as well as their varying manifestations among different Wiccan traditions. What&#x2019;s more, she explains the difference between traditional duotheism and more eclectic polytheistic practices, both of which are found among the diversity of forms within this dynamic religion. You&#x2019;ll find advice for learning to forge your own spiritual connection with the divine masculine and feminine, and introductions to sixteen ancient deities who often function as &#x201c;aspects&#x201d; of the God and Goddess within Wiccan practices. Finally, you&#x2019;ll find ideas for honoring and working with these deities in your magical practice&#x2014;and make no mistake, having the assistance of the gods and goddesses of the Universe is an enormous boon in the magic department!<br><br><p><b><b>Foundations in Wiccan Concepts of Divinity and Magic</b></b></p><br><br>For many practitioners who keep to the traditional duotheistic concept of Wicca, the ancient deities are &#x201c;aspects&#x201d; of the &#x201c;supreme&#x201d; Goddess and God and don&#x2019;t have a role to play on their own. For those who fall into the category of &#x201c;eclectic&#x201d; Wiccans, the inclusion of ancient deities is more polytheistic. Eclectics often have personal relationships with &#x201c;patron&#x201d; gods and/or goddesses, who may be included in ritual practice alongside the God and Goddess. In both approaches, deities may be called upon for assistance with specific magical aims. But it&#x2019;s not simply a matter of speaking a god&#x2019;s or goddess&#x2019; name in your spellwork&#x2014;you need to develop an understanding and personal relationship with your chosen deities. <em>Magical Deities</em> will help you to do just that, with valuable information including:<br><br><ul> <li><b>The history of the Wiccan Goddess and God and their evolution through various traditions</b></li> <li>An introduction to the Triple Goddess and her three aspects: Maiden, Mother and Crone</li> <li><b>Introductions to the Sun God, the Horned God, the Green Man, and the Holly and Oak Kings</b></li><li>How to represent the God and Goddess on the Wiccan altar</li> <li><b>The mythology, cosmology, and magical practices of the ancient cultures that gave rise to Wicca</b></li> <li>The most popular deities of the Egyptian, Roman, Greek, and Celtic pantheons</li> <li><b>Advice for choosing deities to work with, and magical goals and methods specific to each one</b></li></ul>The paths to connection with the God and Goddess, or to any of the deities &#x201c;borrowed&#x201d; from other cultures are as multiple and varied as the people who worship them. Ultimately, your intuition and your heart are your best guides along your journey. But the more you know about the gods and goddesses you seek to work with, the more authentic and astounding your connection with them has the potential to be.

They realized that it was a big subject that could not be put into a few pages, so they &#34;wrote a book.&#34; Friends and neighbors were consulted, gleaning their views and methods of child training. They analyzed how they were influenced by the traditions they inherited from their parents, and they looked at the methods that were unique to their family. Twenty one years later, To Train Up a Child has sold over 1.2 million copies in twelve languages. TTUAC has been on Amazon&#39;s best-seller list several times. This new book has added chapters and several updates. Mike and Debi have received tens of thousands of letters of gratitude and been approached by thousands of young people thanking them for their infl</p><p>Debi Pearl was raised in Memphis, TN, in good homes, by parents who were faithful to point her to God. As a teen Debi was involved in witnessing, ministering to the sick and wounded veterans, and serving in hospitals. Debi along with her husband Michael, write on child training and family relationships. Independently, Debi has written a &#x201c;Help Meet&#x201d; series of books for both single and married women along with the Yell and Tell books which are a warning for children against sexual predators.Three thousand years ago, a wise man said, "Train up a child in the way that he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it." Good training is not crisis management; it is what you do before the need of discipline arises.<br>Most parenting is accidental rather than deliberate. Imagine building a house that way. We don&#x2019;t need to reinvent training. There are child training principles and methods that have worked from antiquity. To neglect deliberate training is to shove your child into a sea of choices and passions without a boat of compass.<br>This book is not about discipline, nor problem children. The emphasis is on the training of a child before the need to discipline arises. It is apparent that, though they expect obedience, most parents never attempt to train their child to obey. They wait until the behavior becomes unbearable and then explode. With proper training, discipline can be reduced to 5% of what many now practice. As you come to understand the difference between training and discipline, you will have a renewed vision for your family, no more raised voices, no contention, no bad attitudes, fewer spankings, a cheerful atmosphere in the home and total obedience from your children.</p><h2>The Ten Commandments of Progressive Christianity (Cruciform Quick)</h2><p><p><i>A cautionary look at ten dangerously appealing half-truths</i></p><p>Not long ago, I came across a list of ten principles set forth by proponents of progressive Christianity. They are, in effect, a new Ten Commandments. What&#x2019;s striking is that they are far less about God revealing his desires and far more about man expressing his own&#x2014;less Moses, more Oprah.</p><p>Yet each of these commandments is partially true. Indeed, that is what makes this list, and progressive Christianity as a whole, so challenging. Half-truths can sound quite appealing until you recognize their foundations and implications. In this booklet, I diagnose and critique each of these tenets and offer a brief biblical and theological response.</p> <p>Liberal Christianity never really goes away. If the church is going to hold fast to &#x201c;the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints&#x201d; (Jude 3), we must, in every era, be able to distinguish the true faith from the false.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet: Plus Dr. Tarnower&#39;s Lifetime Keep-Slim Program</h2><p><b>For more than 40 years, Dr Herman Tarnower warned his patients to eat sensibly and stay trim.

She has a BA in anthropology from Tufts University and an MA from the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, where she focused on environmental communications and sustainable agriculture.

Currently, Jennifer lives with her family in leafy Maplewood, New Jersey.</p>PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;Bass presents a "rainbow of edible colors" in this attractive introduction to colors and grown food. Each two-page spread follows the same format: a photo of a familiar fruit or vegetable is presented, followed by its more exotic counterpart. For instance, Bass informs readers that "Carrots are ORANGE. They are also PURPLE" and includes a photo of a deep purple carrot. Stating, "Look what else can be PURPLE!" she then goes on to provide images of purple corn, a black velvet apricot, blue podded peas, and more. The book contains examples of red, green, yellow, blue, and black, and readers will enjoy lush, attractive images of a red watermelon, a red Dacca banana, a green Gage plum, a Mexican lime, a yellow Amarillo watermelon, Anne yellow raspberries, Russian Blue potatoes, and many more.

For three wonderful evenings, the old gentleman enthralls his assembled local audience with narratives of foolish kings, fabled saints, and Ireland's enduring accomplishments before moving on. But these nights change young Ronan forever, setting him on a years-long pursuit of the elusive, itinerant storyteller and the glorious tales that are no less than the saga of his tenacious and extraordinary isle.</p></p><p><p>Frank Delaney was born in Tipperary, Ireland. A career in broadcasting earned him fame across the United Kingdom. A judge for the Booker Prize, several of his nonfiction books were bestsellers in the UK, and he writes frequently for American and British publications. He now lives with his wife, Diane Meier, in New York and Connecticut. <em>Ireland</em> is his first novel to be published in the United States.</p>When a storyteller comes to visit young Ronan's house, he becomes fascinated with the wanderer's art. His mother is less fascinated, throwing the man out and spawning a search for the man and Ronan's lifelong fascination with storytelling and Irish history. The stories form the backbone of the novel as Ronan traces the man's tales and tries a few of his own. Frank Delaney wrote with the ear in mind, and as narrator he uses his gentle, thoughtful voice to full effect. Like his fictional storyteller, he draws listeners in with the two-part goal of telling truths with a good story and keeping listeners driven to know what happens next.

My water hadn&#x2019;t broken, and the pain wasn&#x2019;t anything I couldn&#x2019;t handle. I&#x2019;d felt just not-right enough to get out of bed, proud of myself for resisting the urge to nudge my sleeping spouse awake. Ben, who was finishing up his first year of medical residency at a big hospital nearby, worked hard. We both did. And I wasn&#x2019;t about to pull the rookie move of waking him up just to watch me have one manageable contraction every twenty minutes. If these things even were contractions. Surely I&#x2019;d have at least one round of false labor, I thought. <br> &nbsp;<br> By the time Ben&#x2019;s alarm went off at 6:15, I was pacing the floor, as much as one could pace in our little apartment. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Definitely shower and go to work,&#x201d; I told him breezily, as he gave me a hug and wrinkled his forehead, looking one part skeptical, two parts impressed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. It&#x2019;s going to be so many hours.&#x201d; I figured&#x2014;if this was even real&#x2014;I&#x2019;d call him when things got interesting. I&#x2019;d grab a cab, and he&#x2019;d leave his department and meet me a couple of floors down at Labor and Delivery. Simple. Low-maintenance mother-to-be. That&#x2019;s me. Plus, it was a Monday. I&#x2019;d finished up my last day of work on Friday, spent the weekend getting organized like a maniac (nesting . . . right . . . that must have been nesting), and wanted at least half a day to sit around and do nothing for the first time since college. Maybe I&#x2019;d go to a movie or watch all the junk TV I&#x2019;d never had time for. I didn&#x2019;t even know which channels were the junky ones.<br> &nbsp;<br> My cervix had other plans. Over the course of Ben&#x2019;s four-minute shower, I had two contractions. And as I leaned over the desk chair in the living room swaying my hips&#x2014;in a way I&#x2019;d never been comfortable doing on a dance floor&#x2014;I changed my mind. We were having a baby. Today. Now. <br> &nbsp;<br> On our way out the door, Ben grabbed the bag I&#x2019;d so lovingly packed a full two months earlier: a blanket, a first little &#x201c;going-home&#x201d; outfit, our good camera, nursing bras, maternity yoga pants. We looked at each other, wide awake and thrilled. Here we go. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh my God, wait!&#x201d; I said as we buzzed for the elevator. &#x201c;I forgot my folder!&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your folder?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Why do you need a folder?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> I ran back in toward the bedroom, stopping to have another contraction leaning over that same chair&#x2014;sway, sway, sway, done&#x2014; and grabbed a yellow folder that held everything I would not want to be doing during my time in the hospital: insurance paperwork; maternity leave disability information from my employer, a big media company; and, yes, some actual work that I took with me from the office before tearfully hugging my boss at <i>Glamour</i> magazine goodbye on Friday. I&#x2019;d do it in labor, I thought. Ha! There was a famous story inside my industry about a particularly She-Ra&#x2013;like editor-in-chief who&#x2019;d faxed back edited copy to the office minutes before pushing out her fifth child. My own boss&#x2019;s boss had taken a quick two-week leave with her first child, and was photographed and interviewed by <i>The New York Times</i> (dressed in Miu Miu, in her beautiful Soho loft) just days after having her second baby. This was what women did, I thought. They balanced!<br> &nbsp;<br> You know how the rest of this story goes. I did not do any actual work at the hospital. <br> &nbsp;<br> What I did do was: have a pain freak-out, then an immediate epidural (I&#x2019;d arrived at four centimeters dilated&#x2014;still proud of that). From the hospital bed, I did a little bit of texting, a lot of moaning, and made a couple of elated high-on-the-epidural phone calls to friends and family&#x2014;not the office&#x2014;and then, finally, I gave birth. Easily, thankfully, with my awesome husband cheering for me harder than he&#x2019;s ever even cheered for his beloved Pittsburgh Steelers. Our son was born. And with eyes nearly swollen shut and a face full of baby acne, he was the most gorgeous thing I&#x2019;d ever seen. That work folder? It sat. <br> &nbsp;<br> I brought the folder home from the hospital, and it sat some more. On a table right next to the bassinet, actually (like I said, small apartment). Eventually, it was covered up by piles of baby detritus: gifts, half-written thank-you notes, an unused Boppy. Still, it haunted me a bit every day. I knew it was there, a little time bomb, just ticking off the minutes until my twelve-week maternity leave would be over. Worried about money, I filled out the disability paperwork, then shoved everything else right back under that pile. <br> &nbsp;<br> Our baby, Will, was six pounds of wonderful, but over those three months, I had what is kindly referred to as &#x201c;a hard time.&#x201d; He wouldn&#x2019;t nurse well or soothe easily. He seemed so tiny; that &#x201c;going-home&#x201d; outfit I&#x2019;d packed for him was miles too big. My body was torn up from top to bottom for weeks. I worried and had crazy, frightening thoughts. Young for parenthood&#x2014;by NYC standards, anyway&#x2014;I had no close friends who&#x2019;d been through this yet. It took all I had just to stroll the carriage one block to the drugstore for diapers. A perfectly capable person, I&#x2019;d made it through college, moved to New York City, broken into publishing, and was on leave from an executive-level position at one of the biggest magazines in the world. In my real life, my work life, I led an award-winning team of editors. I negotiated with celebrities (or, rather, with their &#x201c;people,&#x201d; which is harder). I won awards and got promoted and edited stories urging the women of America to live full lives and demand what they deserved at work, and to do it all in fabulous shoes, damn it.<br> &nbsp;<br> And now, suddenly, simply crossing the street with my newborn baby gave me heart palpitations. <br> &nbsp;<br> After a few days, Ben went back to work, and his life resumed some semblance of normalcy, except for the crazy wife who now greeted him desperately at the door when he arrived home. Used to be, I was the one who worked late. <br> &nbsp;<br> I told everyone that Will was an easy baby, assuming the problem in this equation was me. When he was fussy I relied, appreciatively, on the bible of baby soothing, Dr. Harvey Karp&#x2019;s The Happiest Baby on the Block. Dr. Karp advised swaddling, shushing, swinging, and a whole bunch of other S verbs meant to replicate the feeling of being in the womb. The first three months of a fullterm baby&#x2019;s life, he explained, were actually premature. Because of the size of our brains and heads, human babies are born three months early and essentially have a &#x201c;fourth trimester&#x201d; outside of the womb. By around week twelve, the good doctor reassured me, my baby would start to wake up to the world. He&#x2019;d laugh, hold his own head up, and look me in the eye and connect. He would be slightly less fragile and fussy, and maybe even start to sleep six hours in a row and nap at the same times every day. I just had to soldier on to week twelve. <br> &nbsp;<br> Week twelve? The irony slapped me hard. That was exactly when I&#x2019;d be going back to work.<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> And thus, the idea for this book was born right alongside my son. Sure enough, Dr. Karp was right. By about week eleven, the hormone clouds started to part over my head. I had loved my child from the beginning, but now he was giving something back. I experienced pure baby joy for the first time. And also, suddenly, work dread. I&#x2019;d never disliked work, always loved the ladder climb and even the late nights. I adored the people I worked with: mostly women, a handful of cool, creative men. All so smart and funny. Incandescent personalities. These were people who preached the gospel of feminism and also gathered round the conference room TV together to watch the world debut of J. Lo&#x2019;s twins.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the thought of leaving my baby&#x2014;who now, newsflash, loved me back&#x2014;killed me. How could I trust this nanny I&#x2019;d just hired? How could I possibly pump enough milk to feed my child? How would I not make an idiot of myself on the job running on only four hours of sleep a night? This going-back-to-work thing was going to be hard. Maybe even harder than what I&#x2019;d just gotten through. <br> &nbsp;<br> And if I&#x2014;a person with a stellar partner, a decent-paying job, a fair boss, and a supportive work environment&#x2014;felt this ambivalent about looming working motherhood, surely millions of other women did, too. <br> &nbsp;<br> What I needed was what&#x2019;s in this book. <br> &nbsp;<br> (What I really needed, let&#x2019;s be honest, was three more months at home with my baby. But that wasn&#x2019;t an option because as the primary breadwinner back then, I also needed an income, and a career that didn&#x2019;t move on without me.) <br> &nbsp;<br> So instead: I needed camaraderie. I needed new ideas and solutions. I needed the actual words to have the conversations that were going to make this transitional period surmountable. <br> &nbsp;<br> I needed to know that it really was <i>just</i> a transitional period, simply a Fifth Trimester.<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> As predicted, reentry was rough at first. I hardly recognized myself. I sat in the same office as before, with that same yellow folder of work poking out of the pocket of my breast-pump bag on my commute, but I was a changed person with new priorities, and a new identity. I saw myself differently now that I was a mother. I could tell that my colleagues saw me differently, too. I&#x2019;d never, ever, ever been the kind of worker to &#x201c;just get by,&#x201d; and now that&#x2019;s what I felt like on a good day. At the office, I mostly kept it together. But at home, I picked fights with my husband over little things that were really about one big thing: He didn&#x2019;t feel as completely at the end of his rope as I did 24/7. I resented friends who made us all reservations for 9:00 p.m. dinners. On the phone, I worried my poor mother endlessly and only took her good advice after rejecting it, tearfully, first.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thank God, it was all temporary. Just like my baby, this working mom had been simply thrown in over her head about three months too early. Maybe you&#x2019;ve seen the pie charts friends post on Facebook about the United States&#x2019; maternity leave policies compared with the other nations in the world. It&#x2019;s abysmal. In Croatia, women get more than thirteen months of paid leave. In the U.K., it&#x2019;s fifty weeks, also largely paid, that you split up with your spouse. In France, workers are paid for at least sixteen weeks at 100 percent of their salaries. Even Japan&#x2014;a country that employs people with sticks to smush commuters onto the crowded subways so they get to work on time&#x2014;grants mothers fourteen weeks at 60 percent pay. <br> &nbsp;<br> Here in the United States, the Family and Medical Leave Act requires employers to hold a job for you for twelve weeks (if you&#x2019;ve been there longer than a year, and work full-time, and your company employs more than fifty people)&#x2014;unpaid. Zero dollars. The only countries with lousier stats than America are Papua New Guinea and Suriname. (Oman, which used to be on this naughty list, recently got with the program.) <br> &nbsp;<br> The reality is that stronger parental leave policies do not negatively impact the economy at all. Of the seventeen countries in the world with the highest consistent economic performance, the United States is the only one that doesn&#x2019;t guarantee paid leave for new mothers. And the United States and Switzerland are the only ones of the bunch that don&#x2019;t also have guaranteed paid paternity leave. <br> &nbsp;<br> Why? Why do American parents get so little when 182 other countries around the world prioritize paid leave? We&#x2019;re a young country, and we were founded on the American Dream: Work hard and move up fast so one generation laps the next. Don&#x2019;t look back, don&#x2019;t press pause. It&#x2019;s not that different from how I felt working in magazines in my twenties. I worked insane hours, often until 2:00 a.m. at one start-up. As a twenty-two-year-old editorial assistant in 2001, my annual salary was $30,000, but I took home nearly double that thanks to overtime. It was an investment in my future, I thought, and I got a lot of experience very quickly and moved up and out to bigger jobs at bigger magazines. I didn&#x2019;t realize back then that things actually would get less flexible as I advanced in my career.<br> &nbsp;<br> The problem with U.S. maternity leave policies has become front-page news and talk show fodder as the situation gets more and more obviously wrong. More than half of mothers of infants under one year old are currently in the U.S. workforce. And as HBO&#x2019;s John Oliver so perfectly put it in his 2015 Mother&#x2019;s Day episode of <i>Last Week Tonight</i>, there&#x2019;s &#x201c;nothing we wouldn&#x2019;t do for moms, apart from [this] one major thing.&#x201d; In late 2013, and again in 2015, the Family Act, a bill led by New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Connecticut congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, proposed twelve weeks off at two-thirds pay, financed by a minuscule 0.2 percent salary contribution to Social Security by all workers (to give you an idea, that would have been $60.00 of my editorial-assistant base salary annually). Sounds sensible, but it hasn&#x2019;t passed yet. Representative Carolyn Maloney from New York has been proposing some form of a similar bill on the federal stage, regularly, doggedly, since 2000. And in the 2016 primaries, the issue burned bright. Bernie Sanders cosponsored the Family Act, Hillary Clinton called for paid leave and affordable childcare as key components of her campaign, and Marco Rubio proposed tax credits for companies that offer paid leave. The plans were debated, but the general consensus on both sides of the aisle was that something must be done . . . or, at least, as Donald Trump put it, &#x201c;Certainly there are a lot of people discussing it.&#x201d; But no dice, yet. <br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile, that leaves the private companies out there to decide to do better than required for new moms; perhaps you work at one of them like I did. Even still, only 11 percent of American workers in the private sector are eligible for paid family leave. <br> &nbsp;<br> A few companies, blessedly, bravely, are sticking their necks out extra far to redefine the norm by offering much more. The tech and big finance industries in particular&#x2014;booming, competitive, healthy companies fighting to woo and keep the best and the brightest workers&#x2014;have made enormous strides recently. And guess who runs those companies? Parents. Sons and daughters. People who get the importance of supporting the next generation of workers and thinkers&#x2014;and the mothers who turned their bodies inside out to give them life. When Richard Branson announced in June 2015 that Virgin Management, a division of his Virgin empire, would extend the new shared parental leave, nearly every news outlet showed pictures of him with his own three grandbabies, all born within the previous year. &#x201c;As a father and now a grandfather,&#x201d; Branson blogged, &#x201c;I know how magical the first year of a child&#x2019;s life is, but also how much work it takes.&#x201d; Hopefully soon that magic will be offered to the tens of thousands of Virgin employees who aren&#x2019;t top executives, too. <br> &nbsp;<br> In March 2015, Vodafone, a massive telecom conglomerate in thirty countries, changed its policy globally to grant a minimum of sixteen weeks paid maternity leave to wo...</p><h2>Where the Forest Meets the Stars</h2><p><p><b>An Amazon Charts, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and <i>Washington Post</i> bestseller, and a Goodreads Choice Award finalist.</b></p><p><b>In this gorgeously stunning debut, a mysterious child teaches two strangers how to love and trust again.</b></p><p>After the loss of her mother and her own battle with breast cancer, Joanna Teale returns to her graduate research on nesting birds in rural Illinois, determined to prove that her recent hardships have not broken her.

He was overlooked by his father, yet chosen by God. He carried the dream to be king from the day Samuel anointed him, but he did not feel worthy to marry the king's daughter after defeating Goliath. David experienced many amazing moments in his life, yet he also endured many traumas. He was the hero of Israel and then became the hunted villain. He went from leading the armies of Israel to being pursued by the same. When David was anointed king in Judah, civil war erupted. Each step that God was establishing David's identity, the enemy was trying to steal it. Defeating Goliath required faith, but taking the throne required identity. It takes a Goliath to reveal a David, and his journey to produce a king. Faith believes what God can do. Identity believes what God can do through you. Let David's journey touch yours.</p><p>"Dale has done a masterful job presenting life-transforming truths.

Everyone in my family was an artist and they all included me in their art. Both my grandparents were painters and my grandfather always invited me (and everyone who visited his studio) to add to his paintings. My dad made sculptures with found metal in the garage next to our house and the best way to talk to him was to think of something to make in his garage with him. <br><br> My parents had a puppet theater company called The Mystic Paper Beasts, with large papier-m�ch� masks and puppets. Some of their shows were stories like The Emperors Nightingale, the story of Queen Isabella of Portugal, the life of Toulouse-Lautrec, or one about the circus called Manimal Zoo. Until we were teenagers my sister, Chloe, and I performed and traveled with them, mostly doing street theater in the piazzas of Europe. My mom helped me a keep all my pictures, stories, and tokens from our travels glued into a journal that I still use for inspiration now. When missing school became more disruptive for me and my interest in being a normal teenager grew, I quit. <br><br> After high school I went to Indonesia by myself and studied Balinese miniature paintings. I realized painting is what I&#x2019;m happiest doing and I could actually go to college where that&#x2019; s all I would do. So I went to Rhode Island School of Design. I spent my last year of RISD in Rome where I painted lots of pictures of saints. <br><br> My first illustration job was a drawing for the New Yorker and soon after Chronicle Books published my book of saints, <i>Lucy&#x2019;s Eyes and Margaret&#x2019;s Dragon</i>. Anne Schwartz offered me my first children&#x2019;s book <i>Mr. Semolina-Semolinus</i>, and I have illustrated over twenty since including <i>The Year I Didn&#x2019;t Go To School</i>, about the experience of traveling in Europe with my parents&#x2019; puppet theater. <br><br> My latest endeavors with Anne Schwartz and Lee Wade are <i>The Boy Who loved Words</i> (Spring, 2006) and <i>The Littlest Grape Stomper</i> (Spring 2007). At the moment, I am working with them on a version of the 19th century poem <i>Wynken, Blynken and Nod</i>. <br><br> Now I live in the Hudson Valley with my husband, who is a furniture maker, and our two daughters Pia and Isabel, who are just discovering for themselves the endless joy of making pictures.</p><h2>All Aboard Trains (All Aboard 8x8s)</h2><p>Freight trains, passenger trains, and super-speed trains&#x2014;they're all here in this colorful collection, filled with easy-to-read facts and realistic pictures, just right for young train lovers.</p><p></p><h2>Skysworn (Cradle)</h2><p>With his duel fast approaching, Lindon is locked away in prison.As a Blackflame, he is too dangerous to remain free.

Candace Whitman&#39;s catchy rhyming text is brought to life by a host of creepy critters from first-time illustrator Steve Wilson.</p><p>A native of Long Island, New York, Candace Whitman studied art history at Yale and went on to earn a master's in art education at NYU. She became interested in children's books while teaching art to kids. Candace is also pursuing a master's of divinity at Princeton Theological Seminary.<br><br>When Steve Wilson was a little kid he found real Bigfoot tracks and crop circles. It's true! Since then he has been drawing weird things like UFOs, mythological monsters, aliens, ghosts, animals, cars, superheroes, clouds, and boats. He also works in TV animation design. He lives in Toronto, Canada.Zany creatures-from furry monsters to more recognizable animals-celebrate different kinds of glittery lines that offer plenty of eye candy. The textural lines seem to have minds of their own as they shimmy across the pages, creating patterns and informing the simple, rhyming verse. On one spread, a mummy's bandages are unwrapped ("lines that curve/ lines that curl"), while on the following page a pink whale's blowhole makes "underwater lines that swirl." Later, a red cat's paw loops through "lines with doggies at the end" (the accompanying image shows nine pink dachshunds on leashes). The creatures-and even a mean-looking thundercloud-brim with personality and create a sense of playful irreverence. --Publishers Weekly<br><br>The humble workhorse of the art world gets its proper due in this clever picture book that celebrates the line in all its permutations wavy, winding, or plain old straight. Whitman's rhyming text catalogs the panoply of lines around us in a concise, appealing fashion ( lines that curve / lines that curl / underwater lines that swirl ), but it's Wilson's bright, graphic illustrations that take center stage. Exuberant scenes, many of which are populated by adorably shaggy monsters, are brimming with topsy-turvy humor, from a cat walking a pack of pink dachshunds to an overheated mummy removing his bandages under the hot desert sun. Throughout the book, a ... raised line cleverly highlights the illustrations' squiggles, dashes, and curves and the words that describe them, making this title ideal for close-up sharing and tactile exploration. A lively introduction to poetry, art, or a simple game of pretend. --Booklist</p><h2>Once Upon a Potty -- Girl</h2><p><p> <i>The classic books on a timeless subject -- for a new generation.</i> </p><p> In 1975, Alona Frankel wrote and illustrated her first book, especially for her son Michael, on how to use the potty. Thirty-two years later, <b>Once Upon a Potty -- Boy</b> and <b>Once Upon a Potty -- Girl</b> are the classic books on potty training and have sold more than four million copies worldwide. These children's books help parents everywhere deal successfully with an often vexing challenge for the whole family. </p><p> Thanks to their timeless words and beloved images, <b>Once Upon a Potty -- Boy</b> and <b>Once Upon a Potty -- Girl</b> are being discovered and used by a new generation of parents. These two books, with their phenomenal staying power, target and meet the needs of an obviously perpetual market. </p></p><p><p> <b>Alona Frankel</b> is the author and illustrator of 30 children's books. Her characters "Joshua" and "Prudence" from the <i>Potty</i> books have gone onto star in other stories and in videos and instruction books. </p><p> Dear Fellow-Parents, </p><p> Once Upon a Potty is best used as a companion volume to a child's new potty. I wrote this book when my own child was toilet training to help him better understand the process. My son was encouraged and excited by this story. It motivated him to make the developmental leap from diaper to potty. </p><p> Potty talk has long been considered taboo in conversation -- even between parent and child. Thankfully, this attitude is changing, and children and parents are all the happier for it. I believe that a frank and open approach to all bodily functions is a good, healthy attitude toward child rearing. I have decided to use "Wee-Wee" and "Poo-Poo" in this book, but I encourage you to read the story with your child using words most suitable for you and your family. </p><p> Learning to use the potty is often a lengthy process, taxing the patience of both parent and child. When success finally comes -- and it should come in its own good time without undue pressure or haste -- it enhances the child's confidence and pride. She has taken another step toward independence. She sat on the potty as a little child and got up feeling ten feet tall. </p><p> It's one small step for mankind, but a giant one for your family. </p><p> Love,<br> Alona </p></p><h2>The World Record Paper Airplane and International Award Winning Designs: The Best of John M.

He&#39;s flown paper airplanes on four continents, countless television programs, at prestigious universities, and for some of the biggest companies in the world.

Can no one stop him?<br><br>The creators of <i>Stick Man</i> and <i>A Gold Star for Zog</i> stand and deliver this fabulous new story of a wickedly loveable villain who gets his just deserts.</p><p>Julia Donaldson served as the UK Children's Laureate from 2011 to 2013 and has written many bestselling and beloved picture books and novels for young readers. She lives in Glasgow, Scotland, with her husband, Malcolm.<br>Axel Scheffler's award-winning books include <i>Room on the Broom</i>, <i>The Snail and the Whale</i>, and <i>The Gruffalo</i>. His illustrations have been published in more than 30 countries. He lives in London, England.PreS-Gr 2-Inspired by Alfred Noyes's "The Highwayman," Donaldson tells the tale of a swashbuckling rat with mask and cape who stops hapless travelers and takes their food at sword point. While he prefers chocolates, puddings, and cakes, he steals clover from a rabbit, nuts from a squirrel, and even hay from his own horse. "The creatures who traveled the highway/grew thinner and thinner and thinner,/While the Highway Rat grew horribly fat/from eating up everyone's dinner." A brave duck in a red kerchief lures the thief to a distant cave, supposedly full of biscuits and buns. While he follows the echoes of his own voice deeper and deeper into the dark, the duck jumps on Rat's horse and takes the stolen food back to her hungry friends. Eventually he emerges on the other side of the hill, becomes a reformed rodent, and finds work sweeping the floor at a cake shop. Scheffler's rich, dark palette creates a brooding atmosphere just right for the Highway Rat's dastardly deeds, and his cartoon-style characters are a wonderful tongue-in-cheek contrast. Humorous details abound, including Gruffalo cookies in the cake shop from this British duo's The Gruffalo (Puffin, 2006).

It involved kings and peasants, cardinals and country priests, monks and merchants. It spread from one end of Europe to the other, and manifested itself in widely differing forms. Yet in spite of its diverse and complex character, to start to understand the Reformation you need know only one name: Martin Luther. Roland Bainton&#x2019;s Here I Stand: A Life of Martin Luther remains the definitive introduction to the great Reformer and is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand this towering historical figure.</p><p>Roland H. Bainton (1894&#x2013;1984) was born in England and came to the United States in 1902. A recipient of many degrees, Dr. Bainton was a specialist in Reformation history. For many years he was Titus Street Professor of Ecclesiastical History at Yale University.

Midway through college, she has finished a novel&#x2014;and manages to find a seasoned agent, then a publisher. But as she climbs the ladder of publishing success, she resolutely adheres to her father&#x2019;s admonition: Men read crime thrillers by men only&#x2014;and so Alexandra Winslow publishes under the pseudonym Alexander Green, her true identity known only to those closest to her, creating a double life that isolates her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her secret life as the mysterious and brilliantly successful Alexander Green&#x2014;and her own life as a talented young woman&#x2014;expose her to the envious, the arrogant, and Hollywood players who have no idea who she really is.

Sometimes their fights lasted for hours. They always ended with a door slamming, and then her father would come up to see her in her bedroom and tell her everything was fine.<br><br>They had been arguing for an hour this time, and Alex could hear her mother screaming. She had a hot Latin temper, and Alex could remember her parents&#x2019; arguments for as long as she&#x2019;d been alive. They had gotten worse in the last year or two, and afterward her mother would be gone for a few days, or a few weeks sometimes, and everything would be quiet for a while when she came back. And then it would start again, like tonight. Her mother had said at dinner that she wanted to go to Miami for a few days to see friends, her father had reminded her unhappily that she&#x2019;d just been there, and then they sent Alex upstairs. Her mother didn&#x2019;t care who heard them fight, but her father always sent Alex to her room. She put her pillows over her head as she tried not to listen, but you could hear them all over the house. They lived in a residential neighborhood of Boston, and sometimes Alex&#x2019;s friends next door said they could hear them too. Her mother did most of the shouting, and threw things sometimes, while Alex&#x2019;s father tried to calm her down before she broke something or one of the neighbors called the police. That hadn&#x2019;t happened yet, but he was afraid that one day it might.<br><br>Carmen Cortez and Eric Winslow had met in Miami when he was there on a business trip. He was the head of a construction firm that built office buildings and specialized in banks. He was there for a job they were bidding on, and had gone to dinner alone at a lively restaurant on the first night of his trip. He had seen a group of attractive young people walk in, and heard them speaking Spanish when they sat down at a table next to his, and a spectacular looking young woman had instantly caught his eye. Sensing him watching her, she had glanced over and smiled at him. He was a goner after that.<br><br>Eric was a sensible man with a quiet life. He had been married to a college professor who had died of breast cancer two years before, after putting up a noble fight. They had no children, and had made a conscious decision not to have any, due to health problems his wife had had all her life. They had never been unhappy about their decision, and accepted it as a reasonable choice for them.<br><br>He had done well at his job over the years, Barbara enjoyed her work teaching American history at Boston University, and they loved their home, which felt too large for him without her. He had expected them to spend their golden years together and hadn&#x2019;t anticipated being widowed at forty-�eight. That hadn&#x2019;t been in their plan, and once she was gone, he felt like a marble in a shoebox, rolling around, lost at home, as he sat alone reading in his den every night. Everything seemed so meaningless without her. He traveled for business frequently, but there was no one to come home to, no one to tell about the projects he was working on, and he had thought this trip to Miami would be no different. The silence in the house would be deafening when he got back. Their housekeeper, Elena, still came in several times a week and prepared meals she left for him in the freezer, and he put them in the microwave when he got home from work. He had no family, no siblings, no children, and he felt like a fifth wheel now with their friends, and spent most of his nights and weekends alone. His only pleasure and distraction were the crime thrillers he loved to read. He had a bookcase full of them.<br><br>He was surprised when a live salsa band started playing at the restaurant during dinner the night he met Carmen, and even more so when she got up and invited him to dance. She was wearing a short, low-�cut red dress that clung to her perfect body, and she told him that she was a model and occasional actress. She had come from Cuba at eighteen four years before. They danced for a few minutes, and then with a warm smile she went back to her friends. He had no idea what had gotten into him when he agreed to dance with her, it was unlike him, but she was so dazzling that when she walked over to him, he couldn&#x2019;t decline. She concentrated on her friends after that, and he noticed that they laughed a lot, and he felt faintly ridiculous, but he gave her his business card when he left the restaurant, and told her where he was staying in Miami. He was certain that a woman as vivacious and young as Carmen would never call him.<br><br>&#x201c;If you ever come to Boston . . .&#x201d; he said, thinking of how foolish he sounded. He was twenty-�eight years older than she was, more than twice her age. He realized full well how old he must seem to her and her friends, but he had never met another woman as exciting in his life. She had black hair and green eyes, light olive skin, a tan, and a flawless body. He thought of her all night, and was stunned when she called him at the hotel the next morning, before he left for a meeting. He invited her to dinner, and she told him where to meet her, and he was obsessed with images of her all day.<br><br>She looked fabulous when he saw her at the restaurant, wearing a short black dress and high heels. They went dancing after dinner, and then to a bar she suggested, and they talked until four a.m. He was fascinated by her. She explained to him that she was a trade show model, and had dreams of going to L.A. or New York for a big acting career. And in the meantime, since arriving from Havana, she had worked as a waitress, a model, a bartender, and a disco dancer to make ends meet. She spoke excellent English, with an accent, and he thought she was the most beautiful girl he&#x2019;d ever seen. He was leaving for Boston the next day, but he said if his firm got the Miami project, he&#x2019;d be back in town frequently. In the end, he returned to Miami two weeks later, just to see her. They had a fantastic weekend, and within a month, he was head over heels in love, and totally besotted with her. It seemed foolish at his age, but he didn&#x2019;t care.<br><br>Eric took Carmen to restaurants she had heard of but never been to, and they went for long walks on the beach. And on the second weekend he came to visit her, she stayed at his hotel with him. Eric was a handsome man, with a trim, athletic physique, and she said she wasn&#x2019;t bothered by his age. He was aware of her financial struggles and offered to help her, but she always thanked him and declined. His firm didn&#x2019;t get the project that they&#x2019;d bid on in Miami, but three months after they started dating, in a moment of impulsive madness totally uncharacteristic of him, Eric asked Carmen to marry him. And she accepted.<br><br>They were married by a justice of the peace in Miami. Although her mother couldn&#x2019;t leave Havana, a handful of Carmen&#x2019;s friends were present, and he had arranged for a wedding dinner at the Fontainebleau Hotel, which Carmen loved. At the end of the weekend, Carmen took her three suitcases full of everything she owned and flew to Boston with him for the first time. When they arrived, he carried his exotic bride over the threshold into a world that was totally unfamiliar to her. Her first months were acute culture shock. The weather was cold and gray, and it snowed frequently, which she hated. She was cold all the time, bored while he was at work, and missed her friends. He took her to Miami after a few months to see her pals. They were all envious of her comfortable new life, although dubious about his age. And six months after they were married, Eric and Carmen were both surprised when they discovered she was pregnant. It was an accident, but after careful thought, Eric felt it was a fortuitous one. Having children had never been an option with Barbara&#x2019;s health, but now the idea of a baby delighted him, and he hoped it would be a son to carry on his name. He would teach him to play baseball since he was an avid sports fan, and take him to games. He might even coach him in Little League. He thought a baby would help to bond Carmen to him, since she still felt out of place in his conservative Boston world and had no friends of her own there. She didn&#x2019;t like his friends and found them boring, so they spent their time with each other.<br><br>Carmen was considerably less excited about the baby than he was, and didn&#x2019;t feel ready for motherhood at twenty-�two. It would shelve her modeling career for a year, although she hadn&#x2019;t been able to get work in Boston, and she had nothing to do all day. Eventually she watched Spanish soap operas on TV until Eric got home from work, and waited for the baby to arrive. It was due in February. And having convinced each other it was a boy, they decorated the nursery in blue. Eric could hardly contain himself he was so excited, and bought a box of cigars to hand out on the big day.<br><br>Alexandra was born on the night of a blizzard in Boston. The delivery was worse than anything Carmen had imagined, and than he had feared. The doctor said it was normal for a first labor to be lengthy, and for the delivery to be as rough as it was. Carmen didn&#x2019;t even want to see the baby once it was born. Eric had been in the delivery room with her, and there was a shocked silence when the doctor announced that it was a girl. It took Eric several hours to get over his disappointment, but once he held her, he fell in love with his daughter. Carmen was heavily sedated and asleep by then, and she didn&#x2019;t adjust to the baby as easily as he did. Their housekeeper, Elena, took care of Alexandra when they got home, and all Carmen could talk about was getting her figure back and going to Miami to see her friends. She hadn&#x2019;t been in months, since Eric didn&#x2019;t want her traveling in the last stages of the pregnancy.<br><br>Going to a local gym every day and dieting, and as young as she was, Carmen got her figure back quickly, and when Alexandra was three months old, Carmen went to Miami for three days and stayed two weeks, partying with her friends. But she was in much better spirits when she got back. Eric and Elena took care of the baby whle she was away.<br><br>She made regular trips to Florida every month after that, even worked a couple of trade shows while she was there, and left the baby with Eric. She still had no friends in Boston, and their life was too boring and traditional for her. It became rapidly obvious to him that motherhood wasn&#x2019;t Carmen&#x2019;s strong suit. All she wanted was to be in Miami with her friends. And when Alex was a year old, Eric discovered that Carmen was having an affair with a male dancer in Miami. He was from Puerto Rico, and she was tearful about it when she confessed and promised it wouldn&#x2019;t happen again.<br><br>She had several slips in spite of that and committed numerous indiscretions over the years. She was lonely in Boston, she thought Eric&#x2019;s life was tedious and dull, and so was he. Despite Carmen&#x2019;s behavior, he did everything possible to keep the marriage together, for the child&#x2019;s sake as well as his. He was still very taken with his wife in the early years, until it finally dawned on him when Alex was three years old that Carmen was never going to settle down and didn&#x2019;t love him. She might stay with him for practical reasons, and the perks of his lifestyle, but she wasn&#x2019;t in love with him. Eric&#x2019;s worst fear was that she would take the child and leave him, and he didn&#x2019;t want to lose Alex, or even share custody. He knew that if Carmen left him and took Alex to Miami, it would be an unsavory life for the little girl, among Carmen&#x2019;s loosely behaved friends. Alex was his daughter and he wanted her to live a wholesome, traditional life, not the haphazard, dubious one her mother engaged in as soon as she went back to her old familiar world.<br><br>The only way Eric managed to keep the marriage together was by letting Carmen do what she wanted, come and go as she pleased, and he turned a blind eye to her affairs, although he could always tell when there was a new man in her life. She spent all her time on the phone, smiling happily when she got calls from him.</p><h2>The Basque Dragon (The Unicorn Rescue Society)</h2><p><b><i>The Unicorn Rescue Society is back! </i></b><br> <b><br>Across the vast, blue ocean, in the mountains of the Basque Country, a fearsome creature has gone missing.

When I, Professor Mito Fauna, was a young man, I lived in the foothills of Peru. One day, there were rumors in my town of a unicorn in danger, far up in the mountains. At that instant I founded the Unicorn Rescue �Society&#x2014;I was the only member&#x2014;and set off to save the unicorn. When I finally located it, though, I saw that it was&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;a unicorn, but rather a qarqacha, the legendary two-headed llama of the Andes. I was very slightly disappointed. I rescued it anyway. Of course.</p><p>Now, many years later, there are members of the Unicorn Rescue Society all around the world. We are sworn to protect all the creatures of myth and legend.

Kids were walking past on their way to school, kicking red and yellow leaves. It smelled of fall.</p><p>Why was Elliot lying facedown on the pavement?</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t sure. He had opened his front door, stepped on something, and then gone toppling headfirst down the steps. Elliot pushed himself up and turned around to see what he had tripped on.</p><p>On his front step was a small package, wrapped in brown paper. He got to his feet and walked over to the package. No address. No stamps. Just a name, scrawled in brown ink. Weird. He examined the name on the package.</p><p>It was his name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Elliot had had a <i>strange</i> day yesterday. It had been his first day at his new school. He&#x2019;d made a friend, Uchenna Devereaux. She was odd. She kinda dressed like a punk rocker, she made up random songs about nothing at all, and she had a strong desire to put herself, and Elliot, in mortal danger. All that said, she was funny and she was brave and Elliot liked her. They had rescued a young Jersey Devil&#x2014;which was supposed to be an imaginary creature, but definitely was <i>not</i> imaginary. It seemed to have adopted them. Finally, a terrifying teacher at their school, named Professor Fauna, had invited them to join a secret organization: the Unicorn Rescue Society. Its mission was to save mythical creatures from danger.</p><p>So yeah, it had been a strange day.</p><p>Now Elliot was staring at a mysterious package that had been left on his doorstep.</p><p>For him.</p><p>He tore open the paper. A book stared up at him. <i>The Country of Basque</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Elliot said out loud, to no one.</p><p>Why had someone left him a book? On his doorstep? And who had left it? And couldn&#x2019;t he just have a normal, not-at-all dangerous second day at South Pines Elementary? Please?</p><p>He sighed, tucked the book under his arm, threw his backpack over his shoulder, and started off to school.&nbsp;</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Chapter Two</b></p><p>Uchenna Devereaux normally left her house with one shoe untied, half her homework still under the bed upstairs, playing air guitar, and singing a song she&#x2019;d made up that morning in the shower.</p><p>But not today.</p><p>She opened her front door and looked down her street in both directions before slipping out into the cool autumn morning. She put her backpack over her shoulders, pulled the straps tight, and began walking, warily, to school. Yesterday had been a weird day.</p><p>She had made a new friend named Elliot. He wasn&#x2019;t exactly <i> cool</i>&#x2014;he got nervous easily, he memorized entire books about things that could kill him, and he was definitely <i>not</i> rock-and-roll. But he was smart and funny, and Uchenna liked him. Also, they&#x2019;d met a Jersey Devil and been invited by the school&#x2019;s weirdest teacher to join a secret society. This secret society had very rich and very powerful enemies: the Schmoke brothers, two billionaires who owned businesses all over the world, and half their little town.</p><p>Also, Uchenna and Elliot and that weird teacher <i>may</i> have broken into the Schmoke brothers&#x2019; mansion.</p><p>Okay, they definitely did.</p><p>Which was why Uchenna was being so vigilant this morning on her walk to school. As she turned the corner from her block onto the main street, she glanced over her shoulder. A few blocks away lay the wealthiest neighborhood in town&#x2014;where the Schmoke brothers&#x2019; mansion was. Beyond that, in the distance, she could just make out the towering smokestacks of the Schmoke Industries power plant, billowing black plumes into the air. She&#x2014;<i>FTHUMP!</i></p><p>Uchenna sat down hard on her rear end. A small, thin boy with curly brown hair was lying on his back on the sidewalk, staring up into space. An open book lay on the sidewalk behind him.</p><p>&#x201c;Elliot!&#x201d; Uchenna exclaimed.</p><p>&#x201c;Ow,&#x201d; said Elliot.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see you there!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good. The alternative would have been that you <i>did</i> see me there and ambushed me on purpose.&#x201d;</p><p>Uchenna laughed and got to her feet. &#x201c;Come on. Let&#x2019;s get to school.&#x201d;</p><p>Elliot lay unmoving on the ground. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. Today&#x2019;s been pretty messed up already. School&#x2019;s only going to make it worse.&#x201d;</p><p>Uchenna grabbed Elliot by the wrist and pulled him to his feet. She scooped up <i>The Country of Basque</i> and handed it to him. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go. However messed up today&#x2019;s going to be, it&#x2019;ll be better if we face it together.&#x201d;</p><p>As Elliot brushed off his khaki pants, he squinted at Uchenna. &#x201c;Your positivity disgusts me.&#x201d;</p><p>Uchenna grinned, threw her arm around Elliot&#x2019;s shoulders, and dragged him toward school.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Chapter Three</b></p><p>Elliot and Uchenna sat at the far end of one of the long tables in the school cafeteria, waiting for the morning bell to ring. Kids were streaming in the double doors, finding their friends, laughing, clowning, discussing whatever they&#x2019;d seen on television or online the night before.</p><p>Not Elliot and Uchenna, though. Elliot was telling Uchenna about the mysterious book on his doorstep. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t read much of it yet. Just the first five chapters.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You read the first five chapters between your house and the corner where we knocked into each other? That&#x2019;s one block!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re short chapters. And I read pretty fast.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So, what did you learn?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I learned about the Basque people, the Euskaldunak.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The AY-oo-SKAL-doo-nak?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. They&#x2019;re kinda amazing. They&#x2019;re these fierce mountain people, who&#x2019;ve lived nestled between Spain and France and the sea, for thousands of years. Pretty much every great empire of Europe has tried to conquer them, but no one could.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They sound awesome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Definitely.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Any idea <i>why</i> you&#x2019;re reading this book? Or who gave it to you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have two guesses. Both frighten me.&#x201d;</p><p>Uchenna shrugged. &#x201c;You <i>are</i> easily frightened.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One possibility is the Schmoke brothers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Uchenna said, &#x201c;that would frighten me, too. But why would the Schmoke brothers leave you a <i>book</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No idea. A warning? The other person who could have left it for me is&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At that very moment, the cafeteria doors crashed open, and in strode a tall, wiry man with a black-and-white beard and a shock of hair exploding from his skull. He wore an old tweed suit and shoes that had probably been expensive forty years ago. From under his shaggy eyebrows, his eyes roved the faces of the nearby students&#x2014;who cowered before him.</p><p>Which was not surprising, because he looked like he might attack someone.</p><p>The man&#x2019;s name was Professor Mito Fauna.</p><p>&#x201c;The other possibility,&#x201d; Elliot continued, subtly gesturing at the man, who was now peering around the cafeteria as if he were looking for his next victim, &#x201c;is him.&#x201d;</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Chapter Four</b></p><p>Professor Fauna&#x2019;s eyes landed on Uchenna and Elliot, like a predator finding its prey. He began to weave in and out of the lunch tables, making his way toward them. He moved with a crackling, manic energy that made everyone&#x2014;teachers and kids alike&#x2014;jump out of his way.</p><p>He arrived at their table, glancing at the other kids nearby and then running his big brown hands through his wiry hair, making it stand up even straighter.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Buenos d�as</i>, <i>mis amigos</i>,&#x201d; Professor Fauna said. He was from Peru, and his voice was rich and rocky and slightly accented. He could easily have played a secret agent in an action movie&#x2014;if the secret agent had been lost in the wilderness for ten years without a change of clothes or a comb. &#x201c;I hope you have recovered from our adventures of yesterday.&#x201d;</p><p>Every kid at the table turned to stare, first at the professor, and then at Elliot and Uchenna.</p><p>&#x201c;Uh, hi, Professor,&#x201d; said Elliot.</p><p>&#x201c;Yup,&#x201d; added Uchenna quickly. &#x201c;Doing fine.&#x201d;</p><p>Professor Fauna nodded. Then, he hesitated. He began shifting awkwardly from foot to foot. Clearly, he wanted to say something to Uchenna and Elliot, but felt he could not with all the other kids around. He noticed the book that Elliot had been reading. &#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You received my package! I am glad it did not fall into the wrong hands!&#x201d;</p><p>Professor Fauna suddenly seemed to realize how strange that sounded. He looked around. Absolutely every kid within earshot was staring at him. He cleared his throat. &#x201c;Uh, for example, the, uh, the hands of a clock! Those would be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wrong&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because clocks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cannot read!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; both Elliot and Uchenna said at once.</p><p>&#x201c;Never mind!&#x201d; said the professor quickly. &#x201c;Anyway, I would like to request your attendance after school for a meeting of the, um, <i>club</i> we spoke of yesterday.&#x201d;</p><p>One of the kids at the table, a freckly boy named Lucas, asked, &#x201c;What club, Mr. Fauna? Can I join, too?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is&nbsp;the, uh,&nbsp;club for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#x201d; Professor Fauna stammered. &#x201c;For the history, uh, and the philosophy of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Elliot and Uchenna could see that the professor was struggling to come up with a believable cover story. They both tried to think of the worst, most terrible idea for a club they could, so that none of the other kids would want to come. Unfortunately, they blurted out their ideas at the same time.</p><p>&#x201c;Nutrition,&#x201d; said Uchenna.</p><p>&#x201c;Worms,&#x201d; said Elliot.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; said Lucas.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, the Worm-Nutrition Club!&#x201d; exclaimed Professor Fauna, thrusting a long finger into the air. &#x201c;We will be discussing how to feed and care for worms.&#x201d;</p><p>Some of the kids at the table snickered.</p><p>&#x201c;Mostly, we find that they like poop,&#x201d; the professor added.</p><p>&#x201c;Ugh!&#x201d; someone groaned.</p><p>&#x201c;Chicken poop, they like. And duck poop, too. Cat poop, on the other hand&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They get the idea, Professor,&#x201d; said Uchenna.</p><p>Lucas looked positively queasy. &#x201c;Actually, I have soccer after school.&#x201d;</p><p>Professor Fauna beamed at Elliot and Uchenna and then winked. They rolled their eyes. &#x201c;Come to my office. You know where it is.&#x201d; He gave them a little salute and then strode away through the cafeteria.</p><p>A girl leaned toward Uchenna. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve seen his office? I heard he has a torture chamber under the school. Is that true?&#x201d;</p><p>Uchenna looked at Elliot. He shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;Something like that,&#x201d; Uchenna replied.</p></p><h2>Fantasy World-Building: A Guide to Developing Mythic Worlds and Legendary Creatures (Dover Art Instruction)</h2><p>When artists and designers explore or create a fictional setting, the milieu must be completely fleshed out, explained, and designed. In this book, comic&nbsp;and gaming art veteran Mark A. Nelson explores and demonstrates his methods for fashioning visually stunning, believable environments for fantasy creatures and characters. Scores of images and step-by-step examples illustrate how variation and experimentation lead to fresh, original designs for otherworldly beings, their environments, and their stories.<br> Nelson discusses how to find ideas and borrow from history to add the strength of realism to a fantasy world. In describing the best ways to establish a habitat, he offers specifics about climate, terrain, flora, and&nbsp;wildlife. He shares insights into founding societies in terms of their means of survival, manner of warfare, spiritual practices, style of dress, and levels of technology. All visual creatives who work with imaginative material &#x2014; illustrators, comic artists, and writers &#x2014; will take a lively interest in this source of inspiration and practical knowledge.<br><br> "In sixteen breezy-yet-surprisingly-concise chapters he covers everything from visual problem solving to spirituality to warfare to transportation, not with the idea of giving the reader lessons to copy by rote but rather as prompts to develop their own original concepts. If I were suggesting three books every budding artist should have at their fingertips they would be <i>Figure Drawing for All It's Worth</i> by Andrew Loomis, <i>Imaginative Realism: How to Paint What Doesn't Exist</i> by James Gurney, and, most definitely, Mark's <i>Fantasy World-Building</i>." &#x2014; Muddy Colors</p><p>Artist Mark Nelson specializes in designs for role-playing games and comic books. Since 1985, his work has appeared in many Dungeons &amp; Dragons books and <i>Dragon </i>magazine. He has also produced artwork for the games Villains and Vigilantes, Earthdawn and Shadowrun, and Orpheus, and he has illustrated cards for the collectible game Magic: The Gathering.</p><h2>Safety-First Retirement Planning: An Integrated Approach for a Worry-Free Retirement (The Retirement Researcher Guide Series)</h2><p>Two fundamentally different philosophies for retirement income planning, which I call probability-based and safety-first, diverge on the critical issue of where a retirement plan is best served: in the risk/reward trade-offs of a diversified and aggressive investment portfolio that relies primarily on the stock market, or in the contractual protections of insurance products that integrate the power of risk pooling and actuarial science alongside investments. The probability-based approach is generally better understood by the public. It advocates using an aggressive investment portfolio with a large allocation to stocks to meet retirement goals. My earlier book How Much Can I Spend in Retirement? A Guide to Investment-Based Retirement Strategies provides an extensive investigation of probability-based approaches. But this investments-only attitude is not the optimal way to build a retirement income plan. There are pitfalls in retirement that we are less familiar with during the accumulation years. The nature of risk changes. Longevity risk is the possibility of living longer than planned, which could mean not having resources to maintain the retiree&#x2019;s standard of living. And once retirement distributions begin, market downturns in the early years can disproportionately harm retirement sustainability. This is sequence-of-returns risk, and it acts to amplify the impacts of market volatility in retirement. Traditional wealth management is not equipped to handle these new risks in a fulfilling way. More assets are required to cover spending goals over a possibly costly retirement triggered by a long life and poor market returns. And yet, there is no assurance that assets will be sufficient. For retirees who are worried about outliving their wealth, probability-based strategies can become excessively conservative and stressful.This book focuses on the other option: safety-first retirement planning. Safety-first advocates support a more bifurcated approach to building retirement income plans that integrates insurance with investments, providing lifetime income protections to cover spending. With risk pooling through insurance, retirees effectively pay an insurance premium that will provide a benefit to support spending in otherwise costly retirements that could deplete an unprotected investment portfolio. Insurance companies can pool sequence and longevity risks across a large base of retirees, much like a traditional defined-benefit company pension plan or Social Security, allowing for retirement spending that is more closely aligned with averages. When bonds are replaced with insurance-based risk pooling assets, retirees can improve the odds of meeting their spending goals while also supporting more legacy at the end of life, especially in the event of a longer-than-average retirement. We walk through this thought process and logic in steps, investigating three basic ways to fund a retirement spending goal: with bonds, with a diversified investment portfolio, and with risk pooling through annuities and life insurance. We consider the potential role for different types of annuities including simple income annuities, variable annuities, and fixed index annuities. I explain how different annuities work and how readers can evaluate them. We also examine the potential for whole life insurance to contribute to a retirement income plan. When we properly consider the range of risks introduced after retirement, I conclude that the integrated strategies preferred by safety-first advocates support more efficient retirement outcomes. Safety-first retirement planning helps to meet financial goals with less worry. This book explains how to evaluate different insurance options and implement these solutions into an integrated retirement plan.</p><p>Wade D. Pfau, Ph.D., CFA, RICP, is the director of the Retirement Income Certified Professional designation and a Professor of Retirement Income at The American College of Financial Services in King of Prussia, PA. As well, he is a Principal and Director for McLean Asset Management. He holds a doctorate in economics from Princeton University and publishes frequently in a wide variety of academic and practitioner research journals on topics related to retirement income. He hosts the Retirement Researcher website, and is a contributor to Forbes, Advisor Perspectives, Journal of Financial Planning, and an Expert Panelist for the Wall Street Journal. He is the author of the books, Safety-First Retirement Planning: An Integrated Approach for a Worry-Free Retirement, How Much Can I Spend in Retirement? A Guide to Investment-Based Retirement Income Strategies, and Reverse Mortgages: How to Use Reverse Mortgages to Secure Your Retirement.Throughout his densely packed account, the author helpfully lays out for readers the various aspects of his topic in a fierce amount of specific details. His book comes replete with useful charts and graphs and extensive suggestions for further reading. All of this supporting material is buttressed by Pfau's own considerable skill at clarifying even the most abstruse subject facing retirees, whether it be the various kinds of annuities the author backs for his income-pooling conception of retirement income or the complexities of navigating those instruments, in the form of things like rollup and withdrawal rates. More and more Americans are retiring, and they are living longer than ever before. But the contours of that retired life have been fundamentally changing for decades; the days of people guaranteeing their financial securities with one simple retirement plan are largely gone. Pfau's manual uses as its starting point this complicated new landscape. He carefully takes readers through the arcana of terms and plans and the realities they'll face in their retirement years, explaining everything with a straightforward prose that will be a boon to those dealing with this challenging time. The author's goal is to help individuals lay the foundation for not only financial competence in retirement, but also the ability to spend comfortably in those years. Pfau wants this group to achieve what he characterizes as the four financial goals of retirement: lifestyle, liquidity, longevity, and legacy.<br><br>A formidably detailed and invaluably clear guide to not just achieving retirement security, but also maintaining it.<br><br>- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><h2>Navigating Polarities: Using Both/And Thinking to Lead Transformation</h2><p><p>How do you do two seemingly opposite things at once?

If you look on the super- market shelves, you&#x2019;ll see numer- ous dog foods that claim to aid in intelligence. I don&#x2019;t know if diet can&nbsp;increase intelligence, and dogs cannot take IQ tests to prove this one way or the other. However, I do believe &#x201c;stimulating&#x201d; a dog during early puppyhood can result in a stronger, more balanced brain.<br> &nbsp;<br> A puppy&#x2019;s brain is like a sponge&#x2014;soaking up all the smells and sights and experiences in the world as fast as it can. A well-stimulated pup will grow up to have a larger brain with more cells, bigger cells, and more interconnections between them. Hearing loud noises, getting regular exercise, meeting new dogs and people, traveling to new places, and even going through agility course training for a few minutes each day make for a stronger brain. We can influence the development of a puppy&#x2019;s brain by providing him with the best environment possible when he is a newborn pup.<br> &nbsp;<br> Likewise, a dog that is deprived of stimulation or that doesn&#x2019;t have interactions with other dogs or humans is more likely to have a smaller brain and be less balanced. I have seen many situations in which an understimulated dog is not only an unhappy dog but also a dull, almost lifeless animal.<br> &nbsp;<br> But, conversely, too much of a good thing can be harmful. I have also seen situations in which overstimulating a dog can lead to behavior problems and aggression. Signs of overstimulation can be seen in a dog who enters a room or approaches another dog face-to-face, with his tongue hanging out, gasping for breath, and pulling on the leash or barking. A lot of dog owners misinterpret these signs as those of a &#x201c;happy&#x201d; dog, but in reality, such dogs are out of control. When you see these signs, your dog needs calm, deliberate handling, and it&#x2019;s best to move him away from whatever is overstimulating him until he has calmed down.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Challenging Your Dog&#x2019;s Mind:</b><br> Keeping your dogs mentally challenged and constantly exposing them to new things are just as important as taking them for walks and exercising them. Bored dogs develop destructive behaviors and take their negative energy out on things like your furniture. Here are some creative ways to stimulate your dog&#x2019;s mind:<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. Work on a new trick. Every time you engage your dog in a training session, you are providing him with a mental challenge. Search around for new tricks to learn and practice. If you&#x2019;re ready to move past the basic commands of &#x201c;sit,&#x201d; &#x201c;stay,&#x201d; and &#x201c;come&#x201d; . . . try linking commands together like &#x201c;retrieve and sit.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> 2. Play with interactive games or toys. Dog toys have evolved beyond rubber squeaky toys and cloth squirrels. I like to use canine puzzles that allow you to hide treats and objects inside the puzzle, which engage your dog in figuring out how to work them out. If you don&#x2019;t have a puzzle, you can hold a treat in one hand and let your dog figure out which hand is hiding the treat. Because dogs have such a powerful sense of smell, your dog will guess right 100 percent of the time.<br> 3. Change your walk routine. Try a different street or park just to keep it interesting for your dog.<br> &nbsp;<br> 4. Give your dog a job to do. Dogs are bred to complete tasks like hunting and herding. Engage your dog in a game of&nbsp;Frisbee. Get him involved in a sport like agility or flyball. Find jobs that fulfill your dog&#x2019;s breed.<br> 5. Socialize your dog. Dogs are social animals, and you should nurture the need for social activity by planning playdates with other compatible dogs.</p><h2>Historical and Chronological Context of the Bible</h2><p>Take in the full history of the Bible with a detailed account that focuses on its major empires, events and personalities. Written by a religious scholar who has taught at high school, college and adult levels, this historical exploration is organized around the major civilizations and epochs of the ancient world, beginning with Sumer and ending with Rome. Author Bruce W. Gore provides a thorough overview of major empires, such as the Assyrians or Babylonians, as well as more modest civilizations, such as the Phoenicians or Hittites. Learn how Cyrus the Persian, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, and others changed the course of Christianity. In the course of historical exploration, this account also examines questions that may have puzzled readers of the Bible in the past: � Who was Sennacherib? � To which Assyrian king did Jonah preach, and did this make any difference in history? � What did the "eight night visions" of Zechariah mean in light of the rule of Darius the Persian?

I was tired of being tired, burned out on busy. And, it seemed almost everyone I talked with was in the same boat: longing for connection, meaning, depth, but settling for busy.</p><p>I am a wife, mother, daughter, sister, friend, neighbor, writer, and I know all too well that settling feeling. But over the course of the last few years, I&#x2019;ve learned a way to live, marked by grace, love, rest, and play. And it&#x2019;s changing everything.</p><p><em>Present Over Perfect</em> is an invitation to this journey that changed my life. I&#x2019;ll walk this path with you, a path away from frantic pushing and proving, and toward your essential self, the one you were created to be before you began proving and earning for your worth.</p><p>Written in Shauna&#x2019;s warm and vulnerable style, this collection of essays focuses on the most important transformation in her life, and maybe yours too: leaving behind busyness and frantic living and rediscovering the person you were made to be. <em>Present Over Perfect</em> is a hand reaching out, pulling you free from the constant pressure to perform faster, push harder, and produce more, all while maintaining an exhausting image of perfection.</p><p>Shauna offers an honest account of what led her to begin this journey, and a compelling vision for an entirely new way to live: soaked in grace, rest, silence, simplicity, prayer, and connection with the people that matter most to us.</p><p>In these pages, you&#x2019;ll be invited to consider the landscape of your own life, and what it might look like to leave behind the pressure to be perfect and begin the life-changing practice of simply being present, in the middle of the mess and the ordinariness of life.</p></p><p><p>Shauna Niequist is the author of <em>Cold Tangerines</em>, <em>Bittersweet</em>, <em>Bread &amp; Wine</em> and <em>Savor</em>. She is married to Aaron, and they have two wild and silly and darling boys, Henry and Mac. They live outside Chicago, where Aaron leads The Practice and is recording a project called A New Liturgy. Shauna also writes for the Storyline Blog, and for IF:Table, she is a member of the Relevant podcast, and a guest teacher at her church. Shauna&#x2019;s three great loves are her family, dinner parties, and books, and she believes that vulnerable storytelling, hard laughter, and cold pizza for breakfast can cure almost anything.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>Returning to the theme of decluttering everyday life and concentrating on what is truly important, Niequist (Savor) weaves together a series of essays concerning her personal experiences overcoming a life overwrought with busyness, stress, and feelings of inadequacy. After years of frantic living, Niequist has come to the realization that she&#x2019;s missing out on the beauty of everyday life with her husband and children---that it will all speed past her if she doesn&#x2019;t slow down and simplify, learn how to say no to demands on her time, and stop worrying about others&#x2019; opinions of her. &#x201c;Present over perfect living is real over image, connecting over comparing, meaning over mania, depth over artifice,&#x201d; she writes, explaining along the way that she&#x2019;s found a new &#x201c;strength&#x201d; in embracing quiet surroundings and in spending time alone. To emphasize her points, she quotes Scripture, but does so sparingly and intentionally---more often than not, her included references to her faith are intended only to bolster her own experiences of mindful living. Her style is conversational, friendly, inviting, and never heavy-handed, making the book accessible to people of all faiths. Women will find the advice hits closest to home. Niequist&#x2019;s latest book is her most satisfying blend of mindfulness, scripture, and self-help to date, offering readers the blueprint for a life lived in the real instead of the ideal. (<i>- Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>I begged Shauna for this manuscript a year ago while it was half-baked. When I finally received it, I read it from cover to cover in one sitting, then sat down at my laptop and wrote four emails bowing out of engagements that no longer fit my life, made two hard phone calls, and gave an end date to two other commitments. Present Over Perfect loaned me the courage, integrity, and permission I&#x2019;d been waiting for. I will go to the grave thankful for this message. It has changed my life. (<i>&#x2015;Jennifer Hatmaker, author of For the Love and 7</i>)<br><br>Most of the teachers I&#x2019;ve had didn&#x2019;t think they were teaching me anything; they just thought we were friends. Shauna is that kind of friend, and this is that kind of book. As you turn these pages, you&#x2019;ll be reminded about what you have loved, where you&#x2019;ve found your joy, and perhaps what you&#x2019;ve misplaced along the way. Most of all, you&#x2019;ll be guided into an honest conversation about your faith and where you want to go with it. (<i>&#x2015;Bob Goff, author of Love Does</i>)<br><br>I cried tears of relief while inhaling Present Over Perfect. I cried because I&#x2019;d completely forgotten that I don&#x2019;t have to earn worthiness, hustle for love, or fight to belong. Shauna&#x2019;s words---equal parts elegant and urgent---invited me to remember that my worthiness, belonging, and beloved-ness are birthrights. I can&#x2019;t think of a more important, more desperately needed invitation. (<i>&#x2015;Glennon Doyle Melton, author of Love Warrior and the New York Times bestseller Carry On, Warrior, founder of Momastery and Together Rising</i>)<br><br>I&#x2019;ve watched Shauna walk this journey away from proving and pushing toward connection and grace, and as a friend, I&#x2019;m proud of her. As a reader, I&#x2019;m thankful to have these pages as an inspiration and guide. For all of us who yearn for meaningful, connected lives but find ourselves sometimes settling for busy, her words are the push we&#x2019;ve been waiting for. (<i>&#x2015;Donald Miller, New York Times bestselling author of Scary Close and Blue Like Jazz</i>)<br><br>Shauna awakens our desire to not miss our lives. Because that pursuit costs us our distracting habits, we need motivation beyond disciplines and rules. We have to want to really live and be with our people and enjoy this gift of a life that God has given us. Shauna&#x2019;s life makes me not want to miss mine, and her words here will make you not want to miss yours. (<i>&#x2015;Jennie Allen, founder and visionary of IF:Gathering, author of Anything and Restless</i>)<br><br>We live in a society that can easily have us running in circles if we aren&#x2019;t careful. And this can result in having a life full of things we actually never intended to sign up for. Shauna helps us take a step back and reset our minds and souls. In these pages you will find wisdom and encouragement to see past temporal success and accolades to experience the deeper, more connected and truly enjoyable life. After all, it is the power of connection with others that helps us thrive in every sense of the word. (<i>&#x2015;Dr. Henry Cloud, New York Times bestselling author of Boundaries and The Power of the Other</i>)<br><br>I have already read this book seven times. It&#x2019;s about pursuing the present over the perfect---but it is nonetheless a nearly perfect thing, a nearly perfect book. Shauna speaks exactly to my condition. (<i>&#x2015;Lauren Winner, author of Girl Meets God, Still, and Wearing God</i>)<br><br>With graceful confession, Shauna has created a memoir of her heart---a racing, fragmented heart that is becoming a contented, loved, and present heart. Reading this book heartened me for her, for her family, for her church, and for her generation. Shauna summons each of us to resist being sucked into the fast-paced draft of saying Yes and offers us a better way: the way of presence, the way of saying No. But this No is a Yes to something far better.

Recent graduates grieve the loss of community, question their place in the world and struggle to find meaningful work. It can be shocking to discover that college did not fully prepare you for the challenges you now face. <em>"It's much rougher than I thought. I thought things would just play out, and they didn't. I don't have friends, I don't have a job and I hang out with my parents every night." &#x2015;Kate</em> But you are not alone. For more than a decade, Erica Young Reitz has specialized in helping college seniors and recent graduates navigate the transition to postcollege life. Drawing on best practices and research on senior preparedness, she offers practical tools for a life of faithfulness and flourishing during a critical, transitional time. This practical guide addresses the top issues graduates face: making decisions, finding friends, managing money, discerning your calling and much more. Discover how you can thrive beyond your undergraduate years. If you feel lost in transition, here are resources to help you flourish as a Christ-follower in a complex world.</p><p>Erica Young Reitz directs Senior EXIT, helping college seniors transition into the next phase of life.

She and her husband, Craig, live in State College, Pennsylvania, with their two children."If the 20s are a training ground, as Reitz writes, then <em>After College</em> serves as a biblically rooted, insightful and engaging training manual."

Drawing on best practices and research on senior preparedness, she offers practical tools for a life of faithfulness and flourishing during a critical, transitional time." (On Campus, Fall 2016)<br><br>"<em>After College</em> provides a thoughtful, biblically sound, pragmatic, and much-needed resource for college seniors and recent graduates. Erica Reitz addresses well the issues of isolation, disillusionment, and frustration while also providing hope and a vision of flourishing for this generation. This book connects young adults with honest expectations for the real world.

Erica Young Reitz manages to convey useful advice with an inspirational voice." (Paul J. McNulty, president, Grove City College)<br><br>"From the opening chapter, 'Go to an Unknown Land,' Erica Young Reitz invites emerging adults on a virtual tour of life in the land beyond college. She conducts the tour from a deeply personal perspective, fully engaging the passions, possibilities, dreams, and dangers travelers will experience on their journey. Reitz's greatest gift lies in her choice to refrain from telling the reader what to do and instead make room for showing the way to enter the unknown land 'with a known God (who knows you).'" (Richard R. Dunn, lead pastor, Fellowship Evangelical Free Church, Knoxville, author of Shaping the Spiritual Life of Students)<br><br>"Life after graduation can take you by surprise. It's easy to get lost. Like reading a trail map before a hike, <em>After College</em> challenges you to think ahead and prepare the essentials you will need for the journey. It equips you to navigate the surprises that will inevitably come your way. With practical topics such as decision making, church, community, and finances, this is a resource I wish I had as I was graduating, and one that I hope to share." (Jen Nixon, campus field ministry national director, Cru)<br><br>"<em>After College</em> is like a conversation with a wiser, older friend&#x2015;someone who knows more and therefore loves more. Drawing on years of working with university students, Erica Reitz opens her heart to the next generation of those who will soon be entering into the marketplaces of the world. She offers uncanny wisdom about what the next years could and should mean for people who long to last&#x2015;people who hope that their undergraduate commitments and loves will deepen over the years, rather than be discarded because the realpolitik of life was more than was expected. I hope this book finds its way into the lives of many young men and women who are on their way into the rest of life." (Steven Garber, The Washington Institute for Faith, Vocation Culture, author of Visions of Vocation)<br><br>"Most of us with college degrees forget what it was like to graduate, but not Erica Reitz. Filled with good sense on a wide variety of topics that matter, <em>After College</em> provides a one-stop resource for young adults who want to honor Christ at a time in life when everything is changing. Both graduates and those who care to help graduates will benefit from Reitz's counsel." (Peter Krol, president, DiscipleMakers campus ministry)<br><br>"A wise road map to life in your twenties, <em>After College</em> is an important resource for emerging adults desiring to flourish in Christ. Filled with godly principles and insightful stories, Reitz's book provides a steady rudder for navigating the tumultuous post-college years." (David Setran, Price-LeBar Professor of Christian Formation and Ministry, Wheaton College, coauthor of Spiritual Formation in Emerging Adulthood)<br><br>"It's far too common! College students graduate and then crash into analysis paralysis, getting stuck on questions like: 'Where do I go?' 'What should I do?' 'How will I get to where I want (or God wants me) to go?' We've needed a reasoned and compelling answer to the post-college crisis for decades, and Reitz has delivered brilliantly in <em>After College</em>. Every college graduate needs this book in hand, preferably six months before graduation. Every disciple-making ministry leader should know its content inside and out." (Brian N.

But as a rapper, he&#x2019;s sometimes not given the credit he deserves for just how great an artist he&#x2019;s been for so long. </p><p>This book wrestles with the biggest themes of JAY-Z's career, including hustling, and it recognizes the way that he&#x2019;s always weaved politics into his music, making important statements about race, criminal justice, black wealth and social injustice. As he enters his fifties, and to mark his thirty years as a recording artist, this is the perfect time to take a look at JAY-Z&#x2019;s career and his role in making this nation what it is today. </p><p>In many ways, this is JAY-Z&#x2019;s America as much as it&#x2019;s Pelosi&#x2019;s America, or Trump&#x2019;s America, or Martin Luther King&#x2019;s America.

Follow your dreams, just like Rube Goldberg! From a young age, Rube Goldberg had a talent for art. But his father, a German immigrant, wanted Rube to have a secure job. So, Rube went to college and became an engineer.<br> <br>But Rube didn&#x2019;t want to spend his life mapping sewer pipes. He wanted to follow his passion, so Rube got a low-level job at a newspaper, and from there, he worked his way up, creating cartoons that made people laugh and tickled the imagination. He became known for his fantastic Rube Goldberg machines&#x2014;complicated contraptions with many parts that performed a simple task in an elaborate and farfetched way. Eventually, his cartoons earned him a Pulitzer Prize and his own adjective in the dictionary. This moving biography is sure to encourage young artists and inventors to pursue their passions.</p><p>Sarah Aronson&nbsp;began writing for kids and teens when someone in an exercise class dared her to try. Since then, she has earned an MFA in Writing for Children and Young Adults from Vermont College of Fine Arts, and published three novels:&nbsp;<i>Head Case, Beyond Lucky</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Believe</i>.

Visit Robert at Neubecker.com.Gr 3&#x2013;5&#x2014;Everyone loves a Rube Goldberg machine, whether you've been mesmerized by a complicated toast-making, orange juice pouring contraption in a movie (you know the type), played Mousetrap, or worked on a slightly wacky high school science project to build one yourself. Aronson's picture book biography recounts moments from the life of an imaginative young boy turned discontented engineer turned driven newspaper cartoonist. Goldberg's observant nature and playful spirit produced decades of popular diagrams of totally unlikely and labyrinthine inventions for the world to enjoy. Aronson's narrative hovers between thoughtful biography and an inspirational tribute to Goldberg's work, which will leave readers wanting more information, especially about the cultural legacy of his ubiquitous cartoons. Neubecker's illustrations are animated and precise, connecting the unpredictable threads of the cartoonist's life to the spirit of his inventions. An image of a dizzyingly complicated sewer system calls to mind the early 20th-century milieu of discovery, invention, and rapid social change in which Goldberg's work was born and flourished. VERDICT Playful illustrations drive this loving biography for elementary-school-age inventors and dreamers.&#x2014;Emilia Packard, Austin, TX</p><h2>The New York Times Greatest Hits of Friday Crossword Puzzles: 100 Hard Puzzles</h2><p><p><b>A NEW day-of-the-week series with 100 puzzles in a convenient portable paperback package</b></p><p>You know you&#x2019;re a seasoned puzzle solver when you can crack the tricky <i>New York Times</i> Friday crossword.

During World War II he served as a combat photographer for <i>Yank</i> magazine in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. After the war he became a freelance photographer for many magazines including <i>Holiday, Town &amp; Country, Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, Travel &amp; Leisure, Look</i>, and <i>Life</i>. He lives in Bedford, New York. Frank Zachary, legendary magazine editor, commissioned many of the photographs in this book for <i>Holiday</i> and <i>Town &amp; Country</i>.Aarons, erstwhile photographer to the rich and famous, has combed his archives to compile a collection of slick, upscale snapshots that vividly capture the lives of the "polo set." After the violence he witnessed as a combat photographer in WWII� Aarons decided that the only beaches he wanted to invade in the future were "decorated with beautiful girls tanning in a tranquil sun"-which are amply presented here. Aarons imparts a nearly tactile quality to these razor-sharp images, and every photograph, from the 1950s through the 1980s, is richly evocative of its era. One 1955 photo captures longtime fashion icon C.Z. Guest poolside in typically modest mid-century swimming attire with her son and dogs. A 1964 spread for Town &amp; Country pictures the deeply tanned "young matrons of Palm Beach" in day-glow floral Lilly Pulitzer dresses. In a 1968 picture, fellow photographer Lord Lichfield is shown on the Italian Riviera wearing groovy yellow pants and flanked by Pucci-clad Italian princesses. Aaron's caption notes that "a photographer's life without a wife" seems to agree with the young cousin to Queen Elizabeth. While much of Aarons' work is focused on "horsey" types, he also turns his lens on creative folks. A dashing Gore Vidal is pictured at his Italian villa, the late Gianni Versace is shown at work in his home on Lake Como and Wanda Horowitz, daughter of Arturo Toscanini, is photographed at her father's podium at La Scala opera house in Milan. Aarons' gossipy captions, which accompany each photograph, help make this striking volume a voyeur's dream. 250 color photographs <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now an internationally successful motivational speaker, Nick eagerly spreads his message: the most important goal is to find your life&#x2019;s purpose and to never give up, despite whatever difficulties or seemingly impossible odds stand in your way.<br><br>Nick tells the story of his physical disabilities and the emotional battle he endured while learning to deal with them as a child, teen, and young adult. &#x201c;For the longest, loneliest time, I wondered if there was anyone on earth&nbsp;<i>like me</i>, and whether there was any purpose to my life other than pain and humiliation.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Nick shares how his faith in God has been his major source of strength, and he<b>&nbsp;</b>explains that once he found a sense of purpose&#x2014;inspiring others to better their lives and the world around them--he found the confidence to build a rewarding and productive life without limits. Let Nick inspire you to start living your own life without limits.<br><br>Nick offers practical advice for realizing a life of fulfillment and happiness by building trust in others, developing supportive relationships, and gaining strength for the journey. He encourages the reader by showing how he learned to accept what he could not control and focus instead on what he could.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b> <br><b><br></b>Includes a&nbsp;<i>Life Without Limits</i>&nbsp;Personal Action Plan to help anyone determine their unique path to a successful life.</p></p><p><p><b>Nick Vujicic&nbsp;</b>is a motivational speaker and the director of the nonprofit organization Life Without Limbs. A long-time resident of Australia, Nick now lives with his wife in southern California.</p>One<br><br>If You Can&#x2019;t Get a Miracle, Become One<br><br>O ne of my most popular videos on YouTube shows footage of me skateboarding, surfing, playing music, hitting a golf ball, falling down, getting up, speaking to audiences, and best of all, receiving hugs from all sorts of great people.<br><br>All in all, those are pretty ordinary activities that just about anybody can do, right? So why do you think that video has been viewed millions of times? My theory is that people are drawn to watch it because despite my physical limitations, I&#x2019;m living as though I have no limits.<br><br>People often expect someone with a severe disability to be inactive, maybe even angry and withdrawn. I like to surprise them by showing that I lead a very adventurous and fulfilling existence.<br><br>Among the hundreds of comments on that video, here&#x2019;s one typical remark: &#x201c;Seeing a guy like this being happy makes me wonder why the hell I feel sorry for myself sometimes . . . or feel that I&#x2019;m not attractive enough, or funny enough, or WHATEVER. How can I even think thoughts like that when this guy is living without limbs and still being HAPPY!?&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;m often asked that very question: &#x201c;Nick, how can you be so happy?&#x201d; You may be dealing with your own challenges, so I&#x2019;ll give you the quick answer up front:<br><br>I found happiness when I realized that as imperfect as I may be, I am the perfect Nick Vujicic. I am God&#x2019;s creation, designed according to His plan for me. That&#x2019;s not to say that there isn&#x2019;t room for improvement. I&#x2019;m always trying to be better so I can better serve Him and the world!<br><br>I do believe my life has no limits. I want you to feel the same way about your life, no matter what your challenges may be. As we begin our journey together, please take a moment to think about any limitations you&#x2019;ve placed on your life or that you&#x2019;ve allowed others to place on it. Now think about what it would be like to be free of those limitations. What would your life be if anything were possible?<br><br>I&#x2019;m officially disabled, but I&#x2019;m truly enabled because of my lack of limbs. My unique challenges have opened up unique opportunities to reach so many in need. Just imagine what is possible for you!<br><br>Too often we tell ourselves we aren&#x2019;t smart enough or attractive enough or talented enough to pursue our dreams. We buy into what others say about us, or we put restrictions on ourselves. What&#x2019;s worse is that when you consider yourself unworthy, you are putting limits on how God can work through you!<br><br>When you give up on your dreams, you put God in a box. After all, you are His creation. He made you for a purpose. Therefore your life cannot be limited any more than God&#x2019;s love can be contained.<br><br>I have a choice. You have a choice. We can choose to dwell on disappointments and shortcomings. We can choose to be bitter, angry, or sad. Or when faced with hard times and hurtful people, we can choose to learn from the experience and move forward, taking responsibility for our own happiness.<br><br>As God&#x2019;s child, you are beautiful and precious, worth more than all the diamonds in the world. You and I are perfectly suited to be who we were meant to be! Even still, it should always be our goal to become an even better person and stretch our boundaries by dreaming big. Adjustments are necessary along the way because life isn&#x2019;t always rosy, but it is always worth living. I&#x2019;m here to tell you that no matter what your circumstances may be, as long as you are breathing, you have a contribution to make.<br><br>I can&#x2019;t put a hand on your shoulder to reassure you, but I can speak from the heart. However desperate your life may seem, there is hope. As bad as circumstances appear, there are better days ahead. No matter how dire your circumstances may appear, you can rise above them. To wish for change will change nothing. To make the decision to take action right now will change everything!<br><br>All events come together for the good. I&#x2019;m certain of that because it&#x2019;s been true in my life. What good is a life without limbs? Just by looking at me, people know that I faced and overcame many obstacles and hardships. That makes them willing to listen to me as a source of inspiration. They allow me to share my faith, to tell them they are loved, and to give them hope.<br><br>That is my contribution. It&#x2019;s important to recognize your own value. Know that you also have something to contribute. If you feel frustrated right now, that&#x2019;s okay. Your sense of frustration means you want more for your life than you have right now. That&#x2019;s all good. Often it&#x2019;s the challenges in life that show us who we are truly meant to be.<br><br>A Life of Value<br><br>It took me a long time to see the benefits of the circumstances I was born into. My mum was twenty-five years old when she became pregnant with me, her first child. She&#x2019;d been a midwife and worked as a pediatric nurse in charge in the delivery room where she provided care for hundreds of mothers and their babies. She knew what she had to do while she was pregnant, watching her diet, being cautious about medications, and not consuming alcohol, aspirin, or any other pain-killers. She went to the best doctors and they assured her everything was proceeding smoothly.<br><br>Even still, her apprehension persisted. As her due date approached, my mum shared her concerns with my father several times, saying, &#x201c;I hope that everything&#x2019;s okay with the baby.&#x201d;<br><br>When two ultrasounds were performed during her pregnancy, the doctors detected nothing unusual. They told my parents that the baby was a boy but not a word about missing limbs! At my delivery on December 4, 1982, my mother could not see me at first, and the first question she asked the doctor was &#x201c;Is the baby all right?&#x201d; There was silence. As the seconds ticked by and they were still not bringing the baby for her to see, she sensed even more that something was wrong. Instead of giving me to my mother to hold, they summoned a pediatrician and moved off to the opposite corner, examining me and conferring with each other. When my mum heard a big healthy baby scream, she was relieved. But my dad, who had noticed I was missing an arm during the delivery, felt queasy and was escorted out of the room.<br><br>Shocked at the sight of me, the nurses and doctors quickly wrapped me up.<br><br>My mother, who&#x2019;d participated in hundreds of deliveries as a nurse, wasn&#x2019;t fooled. She read the distress on the faces of her medical team, and she knew something was very wrong.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it? What&#x2019;s wrong with my baby?&#x201d; she demanded.<br><br>Her doctor would not answer at first, but when she insisted on a response, he could offer my mother only a specialized medical term.<br><br>&#x201c;Phocamelia,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Because of her nursing background, my mother recognized the term as the condition babies have when they are born with malformed or missing limbs. She simply couldn&#x2019;t accept that this was true.<br><br>In the meantime, my stunned dad was outside, wondering whether he had seen what he thought he saw. When the pediatrician came out to speak to him, he cried out, &#x201c;My son, he has no arm!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; the pediatrician said as sensitively as possible, &#x201c;your son has neither arms nor legs.&#x201d;<br><br>My father went weak with shock and anguish.<br><br>He sat stunned, momentarily unable to speak before his protective instincts kicked in. He rushed in to tell my mother before she saw me, but to his dismay he found her lying in bed, crying. The staff had already told her the news. They had offered to bring me to her but she refused to hold me and told them to take me away.<br><br>The nurses were crying. The midwife was crying. And of course, I was crying! Finally they put me next to her, still covered, and my mum just couldn&#x2019;t bear what she was seeing: her child without limbs.<br><br>&#x201c;Take him away,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to touch him or see him.&#x201d;<br><br>To this day my father regrets that the medical staff did not give him time to prepare my mother properly. Later, as she slept, he visited me in the nursery. He came back and told Mum, &#x201c;He looks beautiful.&#x201d; He asked her if she wanted to see me at that point, but she declined, still too shaken. He understood and respected her feelings.<br><br>Instead of celebrating my birth, my parents and their whole church mourned. &#x201c;If God is a God of love,&#x201d; they wondered, &#x201c;why would He let something like this happen?&#x201d;<br><br>My Mum&#x2019;s Grief<br><br>I was my parents&#x2019; firstborn child. While this would be a major cause for rejoicing in any family, no one sent flowers to my mum when I was born. This hurt her and only deepened her despair.<br><br>Sad and teary-eyed, she asked my dad, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t I deserve flowers?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;Of course you deserve them.&#x201d; He went to the hospital flower shop and returned shortly to present her with a bouquet.<br><br>I was aware of none of this until the age of thirteen or so, when I began to question my parents about my birth and their initial reaction to my lack of limbs. I&#x2019;d had a bad day at school, and when I told my mum, she cried with me. I told her I was sick of having no arms and legs. She shared my tears and said that she and my dad had come to understand that God had a plan for me and one day He would reveal it. My questions continued over time, sometimes with one parent, sometimes with both. Part of my search for answers was natural curiosity and part of it was in response to the persistent questions I&#x2019;d been fielding from curious classmates.<br><br>At first, I was a little scared of what my parents might tell me, and, since some of this was difficult for them to delve into, I didn&#x2019;t want to put them on the spot. In our initial discussions my mum and dad were very careful and protective in their responses. As I grew older and pushed harder, they offered me deeper insights into their feelings and their fears because they knew I could handle it. Even so, when my mum told me that she didn&#x2019;t want to hold me after I was born, it was hard to take, to say the least. I was insecure enough as it was, but to hear that my own mother could not bear to look at me was . . . well, imagine how you might feel. I was hurt and I felt rejected, but then I thought of all that my parents have done for me since. They&#x2019;d proven their love many times over. By the time we had these conversations, I was old enough to put myself in her situation. Other than her intuitive feelings, there&#x2019;d been no warning of this during her pregnancy. She was in shock and frightened. How would I have responded as a parent? I&#x2019;m not sure I would have handled it as well as they did. I told them that, and over time we went more and more into the details.<br><br>I&#x2019;m glad that we waited until I was secure, knowing deep in my heart of hearts that they loved me. We&#x2019;ve continued to share our own feelings and fears, and my parents have helped me understand how their faith enabled them to see that I was destined to serve God&#x2019;s purpose. I was a fiercely determined and mostly upbeat child. My teachers, other parents, and strangers often told my parents that my attitude inspired them. For my part, I came to see that as great as my challenges were, many people had heavier burdens than mine.<br><br>Today in my travels around the world, I often see incredible suffering that makes me grateful for what I have and less inclined to focus on what I may lack. I have seen orphaned children with crippling diseases. Young women forced into sexual slavery. Men imprisoned because they were too poor to pay a debt.<br><br>Suffering is universal and often unbelievably cruel, but even in the worst of slums and after the most horrible tragedies, I have been heartened to see people not only surviving but thriving. Joy was certainly not what I expected to find in a place called &#x201c;Garbage City,&#x201d; the worst slum at the edge of Cairo, Egypt. The Manshiet Nasser neighborhood is tucked into towering rock cliffs. The unfortunate but accurate nickname and the community&#x2019;s rank odor come from the fact that most of its fifty thousand residents sustain themselves by combing through Cairo, dragging its garbage there, and picking through it. Each day they sort through mountains of refuse pulled from a city of eighteen million residents, hoping to find objects to sell, recycle, or somehow make use of.<br><br>Amid streets lined with garbage piles, pig pens, and stinking trash, you would expect people to be overcome with despair, yet I found it to be quite the opposite on a visit in 2009. The people there live hard lives, to be sure, but those I met were very caring, seemingly happy, and filled with faith. Egypt is 90 percent Muslim. Garbage City is the only predominantly Christian neighborhood. Nearly 98 percent of the people are Coptic Christians.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve been to many of the poorest slums in all corners of the world. This was one of the worst as far as the environment, but it was also one of the most heart-warming in spirit. We squeezed nearly 150 people into a very small concrete building that served as their church. As I began speaking, I was struck by the joy and happiness radiating from my audience. They were simply beaming at me. My life has rarely seemed so blessed. I gave thanks that their faith lifted them above their circumstances as I told them how Jesus had changed my life too.<br><br>I spoke with church leaders there about how lives in the village had changed through the power of God. Their hope wasn&#x2019;t put on this earth, but their hope is in eternity. In the meantime they&#x2019;ll believe in miracles and thank God for who He is and what He has done. Before we left, we presented some families with rice, tea, and a small amount of cash that would buy them enough food for several weeks. We also distributed sports equipment, soccer balls, and jump ropes to the children. They immediately invited our group to play with them, and we had a ball, laughing and enjoying each other even though we were surrounded by squalor. I will never forget those children and their smiles. It just proved to me again that happiness can come to us under any circumstance if we put our total trust in God.<br><br>How can such impoverished children laugh? How can prisoners sing with joy? They rise above by accepting that certain events are beyond their control and beyond their understanding too, and then focusing instead on what they can understand and control. My parents did just that. They moved forward by deciding to trust in God&#x2019;s Word that &#x201c;all things work for the good of those who love God, who are called according to His purpose.&#x201d;</p><h2>Lonely Planet Pocket Charleston &amp; Savannah (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world&#x2019;s number one travel guide publisher*</i></p> <p><b>Lonely Planet&#x2019;s <i>Pocket</i> <i>Charleston &amp; Savannah</i> </b>is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

On their mission for the Terces Society, 11-year-old Cass and Max-Ernest must find the homunculus, a 500-year-old man born in a bottle, before Dr. L and Ms. Mauvais do. The evil duo plans to use him to uncover the secret of immortality. The use of an overbearing narrator to create a sense of danger works in the beginning, but grows tiresome toward the end. The numerous parenthetical comments and footnotes are often laugh-out-loud funny, but also draw readers out of the action. Bosch creates sufficiently quirky, well-rounded protagonists, while stereotypes suffice for the secondary characters, with the exception of the homunculus. Cynical humor shines through in the portrayal of the Skelton Sisters, an evil tween pop group in the employ of Dr. L and Ms. Mauvais. The dark illustrations, descending chapter numbers, and playful fonts will catch readers' attention. Fans of Lemony Snicket's "A Series of Unfortunate Events" (HarperCollins) will enjoy this slightly more fleshed-out read.&#x2014;<i>Kim Ventrella, Ralph Ellison Library, Oklahoma City, OK</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Considered by Machiavelli as the last of the good Emperors, Marcus Aurelius would become one of the most important of the Stoic philosophers. Educated in oratory, he would turn aside from rhetoric to the study of the Stoic philosophy, of which he was the last distinguished representative. The &#34;Meditations,&#34; which he wrote in Greek, are among the most noteworthy expressions of this system, and exhibit it favorably on its practical side. The work is a series of twelve books that he intended for his own guidance and self-improvement, which picture with faithfulness the mind and character of this noblest of the Emperors. Simple in style and sincere in tone, they record for all time the height reached by pagan aspiration in its effort to solve the problem of conduct. In Marcus Aurelius&#39;s practice of this philosophy along with his teaching he showed that &#34;even in a palace life may be led well.&#34; This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper, follows the highly-regarded translation of George Long, and includes an introduction by Alice Zimmern.</p><p>One measure, perhaps, of a book's worth, is its intergenerational pliancy: do new readers acquire it and interpret it afresh down through the ages? The <i>Meditations</i> of Marcus Aurelius, translated and introduced by Gregory Hays, by that standard, is very worthwhile, indeed. Hays suggests that its most recent incarnation--as a self-help book--is not only valid, but may be close to the author's intent. The book, which Hays calls, fondly, a "haphazard set of notes," is indicative of the role of philosophy among the ancients in that it is "expected to provide a 'design for living.'" And it does, both aphoristically ("Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly.") and rhetorically ("What is it in ourselves that we should prize?"). Whether these, and other entries ("Enough of this wretched, whining monkey life.") sound life-changing or like entries in a teenager's diary is up to the individual reader, as it should be. Hays's introduction, which sketches the life of Marcus Aurelius (emperor of Rome A.D. 161-180) as well as the basic tenets of stoicism, is accessible and jaunty. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i>A series of spiritual exercises filled with wisdom, practical guidance, and profound understanding of human behavior, Marcus Aurelius's "Meditations remains one of the greatest works of spiritual and ethical reflection ever written. Marcus's insights and advice--on everything from living in the world to coping with adversity and interacting with others--have made the "Meditations required reading for statesmen and philosophers alike, while generations of ordinary readers have responded to the straightforward intimacy of his style. <br>In Gregory Hays's new translation--the first in a generation--Marcus's thoughts speak with a new immediacy: never before have they been so directly and powerfully presented. <p>"From the Trade Paperback edition.</p></p><h2>How to Grow a Dinosaur</h2><p><b>A big-kid dinosaur can&#x2019;t wait to teach the new baby <i>everything</i> in this funny, tender, joyful take on becoming a big sister or brother, from the celebrated artist of&nbsp;<i>I Don't Want to Be a Frog</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> Good news: Your mom's hatching a baby!

Illustrated with a blend of historic photographs and eloquent watercolors by Paul Bacon.</p></p><p>Peter Golenbock is a well-known writer of books about sports, espcecially baseball. He lives in Ridgefield, Connecticut.&nbsp;<br><br>Paul Bacon also illustrated <i>Susanna of the Alamo</i>. He lives in Clintondale, New York.Kindergarten-Grade 6-- Golenbock has taken a single moment of baseball history, set it in its social context, and created a simple and moving tribute to courage and brotherhood. While other biographies of Robinson, and Robinson himself in I Never Had It Made (Putnam, 1972; o.p.), set the incident in Boston, Golenbock places it in Cincinnati, near Reese's Kentucky home. The event occurred during Jackie Robinson's first season with the Dodgers. Listening to the hatred that spilled out of the stands, Pee Wee Reese left his position at shortstop, walked over to Robinson at first base, put his around Robinson's shoulder, chatted for a few moments, and then returned to his position. The crowd was stunned into silence. Bacon has illustrated the book with an effective blend of photographs and drawings. Golenbock briefly but clearly describes the background of Robinson's entry into the National League, as well as Reese's background as a southerner and as the player with the most to fear if Robinson were successful--both men were shortstops (although Robinson would ultimately play second base). There have been several recent books about Robinson for young readers, such as David Adler's Jackie Robinson: He Was the First (Holiday, 1989) and Jim O'Connor's Jackie Robinson and the Story of All-Black Baseball (Random, 1989), but none of them have the style or dramatic impact of Golenbock and Bacon's work. This is a wonderful and important story, beautifully presented, but the geographic confusion is disturbing. --Elaine Fort Weischedel, Turner Free Library, Randolph, MA (<i>School Library Journal</i> )<br><br>Set in 1947, Teammates concerns a little-known episode about Brooklyn Dodgers' second baseman Jackie Robinson and the integration of baseball. When Dodgers shortstop Pee Wee Reese, incensed by the abuse coming from a Cincinnati crowd, determined to "take a stand," he put an arm around his teammate's shoulder; this simple gesture symbolized the end of the "color line" in major league baseball--and the beginning of a great friendship. The book's appropriately ironic beginning talks of a time "when automobiles were black and looked like tanks and laundry was white and hung on clotheslines to dry." Golenbock then introduces the Negro Leagues, enumerates the many differences between them and the Major Leagues, and credits Dodger general manager Branch Rickey with finding "one special man" who would exemplify great ballplaying and thereby eradicate the prejudices of the fans. Golenbock's bold and lucid style distills this difficult issue, and brings a dramatic tale vividly to life. Bacon's spare, nostalgic watercolors, in addition to providing fond glimpses of baseball lore, present a haunting portrait of one man's isolation. Historic photographs of the major characters add interest and a touch of stark reality to an unusual story, beautifully rendered. Ages 6-9.

An introduction to prayer-book use from Eugene Peterson is included to acclimate readers to this form.<br><br>"<i>Seeking God's Face </i>melds prayer and Scripture into a companionable guide for becoming a participant--both listening and speaking--in the great salvation conversation that is the Christian gospel."--from the foreword by Eugene Peterson<br><br>"Inspired in every sense of that word and masterfully compiled, <i>Seeking God's Face </i>is a prayer book always and everywhere to be treasured. From our very beginnings, we have understood that fixed daily prayer is just as necessary to the fully realized Christian life as water and food are to the body's sustenance. The problem for many Christians up to now--and especially for those from Reformed branches of the faith--has been the lack of prayer tools and prayer books that accord with their communal traditions. Now, in this one volume, Philip Reinders gives the church not only a solution to that problem but also a God-drenched prayer tool suitable for all of us."--Phyllis Tickle, compiler, <i>The Words of Jesus--A Gospel of the Sayings of Our Lord<br></i><br>"Left on our own, our prayers may tend to traffic in the local and the parochial as we bring before God intramural concerns related to our own work, our own church, our own families. <i>Seeking God's Face</i> helps us pray for those concerns but also brings our hearts out into the wide open spaces of God's Word, God's church, and God's world.

When the grown-ups, who hover at the edges of the story, object, she says, &#x201c;It's just my way.&#x201d; A mouse nests in her tangled curls, but she is unafraid. Rather, she welcomes scores of other mice, enjoying the company of her companions who tell knock-knock jokes and are kind to her favorite doll, Baby. Soon, the girl discovers some drawbacks to her unusual situation. She must share her food with the mice, they refuse to go in the bath, and they keep her awake all night. The hungry, dirty, and exhausted little girl does not know what to do until her teacher tells her that she can't bring Baby to school because she already has too many naptime friends with her. The child gently explains to the mice that it is time for them to go. That night, she washes and brushes her locks and finally gets a good night's sleep. On the playground, a couple of mice scout for a new home in the pigtails of another little girl. It is &#x201c;just their way.&#x201d; The digitally colored illustrations focus on the girl, showing her in her comfortable home or her cheerful schoolroom.

Curled up on the floor in front of a 1970s-style console television, watching <i>Mister Rogers&#x2019; Neighborhood</i>, I would observe my best adult friend change into a sweater and sneakers, play music, and sing. He&#x2019;d introduce me to talented people, show me how crayons and applesauce and wagons are made, and let&nbsp;me peek into a colorful world where no one is perfect but everyone is accepted and appreciated. Then he&#x2019;d tell me I was one of a kind and that people could like me just for being me.<br><br>Revisiting the shows as an adult, I realize there is a depth and intention behind <i>Mister Rogers&#x2019; Neighborhood</i> that I didn&#x2019;t notice as a child. Hidden in plain sight are displays of some of my most deeply held beliefs and the messages I want to share with my daughter: You have value, and so does every other person, so treat yourself and others with care and respect. People&#x2019;s differences should be acknowledged and welcomed. It&#x2019;s okay to talk about the things that make us feel bad. Don&#x2019;t get so busy that you stop recognizing beauty and learning about the world.<br><br>In this book, you&#x2019;ll find quotes and anecdotes taken directly from television visits with Mister Rogers, his neighbors, and the familiar faces of the residents of the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Mister Rogers was always focused on children, but his words are just as important and meaningful to adults.</p><h2>Garfield at Large: His 1st Book</h2><p>Like every great lasagna, Garfield was born in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant on a winter's night in 1978, while outside snow fell like grated Parmesan cheese. He weighed five pounds, six ounces at birth--that's big for a kitten!--and right from the start showed a passion for Italian food. The restaurant owner, forced to choose between Garfield and closing his doors for lack of pasta, sold Garfield to a pet store. Garfield thought he was a goner until Jon Arbuckle walked in the door. <br><br> The rest is history.</p><p>The very first of all the Garfield titles. I remember what a thrill it was to find out that I would be working for the same company that produces the books which made me laugh since I was 13. It&#39;s in this first book that we discover Garfield, the plant eating, food loving (especially lasagna!), mailman terrorizing, furniture destroying, dog hating Red Tabby and his long suffering owner, Jon. Garfield&#39;s closest companion, Pooky the teddy bear, also appears, along with Lyman, the roommate and his dumb as a dead catfish dog, Odie.

His subjects centered on the teeming, noisy streets of Paris, as well as its leisure entertainments, such as horse racing, cabarets, and, most particularly, ballet. With often ambitious, off-kilter vantage points, his images of ballerinas numbered approximately 1,500 works, all deeply invested in the physicality and the discipline of dance.</p><p>Through illustrations of Foyer de la Danse (1872), Musicians in the Orchestra (1872), and many more, this book provides an essential overview of the artist who created a category all his own, a world of classical resonance, bold compositions, and an endless fascination with movement, which together produced some of the most striking and influential works of the era.</p></p><p>This splendid collection of artworks in miniature spotlights the talents of one of the most important&#x2015;and popular&#x2015;French artists of the 19th century. Sixteen of Edgar Degas's most famous paintings, appearing here in sticker format, include <i>The Dance Examination, After the Bath, Ballet Dancers on the Stage, Singer with a Glove, L'Absinthe,</i> and 11 others. <br>Perfect for enhancing stationery items or simply adding to a personal collection, these stunning reproductions will delight lovers of fine art and admirers of works by this major Impressionist. <br>Original Dover (1998) publication.e from <b>The Crown Art Library</b>, the most useful monographs available on a wide range of significant artists.

Lord Endrick could not be defeated. He could not be killed or even wounded, certainly not by the Coracks. At best, they were like fleas to him, a persistent irritation, but a pestilence he would eventually crush between his fingers.<br><br>Sooner than later, I hoped.<br><br>"Endrick is no ordinary man," I said. "Bring an army of a hundred thousand against him if you want. It will do you no good."<br><br>"Not yet, my lady. That's where you come in."<br><br>Almost unwittingly, I sat up straight, shaking my head as fiercely as possible. "What you want cannot be done."<br><br>Tenger leaned in to me. "It will be done, and you will do it. The Coracks have not yet decided who will replace Endrick as ruler of the Scarlet Throne, but he will be replaced."<br><br>"You will hang for this." I tilted my head toward Simon, to be sure the message was clear. "All of you."<br><br>"So you've said." Tenger had probably heard that threat as often as the church bells chimed. "You'll attend our hanging, I assume."<br><br>"I'll give the executioner his orders, gladly." My voice became ice. It frightened me to hear it, to realize I was capable of such words.<br><br>Tenger smiled at my threat. "If you fail us, with similar enthusiasm we will execute your servant girl and driver. Only our methods are far more painful, I can promise you that. Now, what do you know about the Olden Blade?"<br><br>My gut twisted, but I tried not to let my worry show. If the Coracks knew about that dagger, then they needed my help to complete their wicked plans. They intended to make a traitor of me too.<br><br>If I was not careful, I would hang with them.</p><h2>Always We Begin Again: The Benedictine Way of Living (15th Anniversary Edition, Revised)</h2><p>This book holds timeless appeal for readers who hunger for a meaningful and creatively balanced framework for life.

Later, God wished to use Moses and his Ethiopian wife and half-Ethiopian sons to raise up a new race of Jews to replace the twelve tribes of Israel. Let&#39;s not forget that the Almighty did not object when Jacob passed &#34;the blessing of Abraham&#34; on to his half-African grandsons, Ephraim and Manasseh, in North Africa. In light of these facts it&#39;s amazing that early Americans wondered if blacks could be saved especially since it was big news to Jews that gentiles (Europeans) could be saved. Prior to the Apostles of Christ&#39;s debate about whether Europeans, called gentiles in Scripture, could be saved, Niger and Lucius were black Bible teachers at Antioch (where believers were first called Christians) and an Ethiopian eunuch had been saved and baptized. (Acts 13:1, 15:7) The first king, queen, prince, and princess in the Bible were black. It was an African princess who found Moses floating down the Nile in Africa. Later Esther a dark skinned Jew won a black beauty contest that stretched from India to Ethiopia.

In addition, specs grading increases students&#x2019; motivation to do well by making expectations clear, lowering their stress and giving them agency in determining their course goals. <br><br>Among the unique characteristics of the schema, all of which simplify faculty decision making, are the elimination of partial credit, the reliance on a one-level grading rubric and the &#x201c;bundling&#x201d; of assignments and tests around learning outcomes. Successfully completing more challenging bundles (or modules) earns a student a higher course grade. Specs grading works equally well in small and large class settings and encourages &#x201c;authentic assessment.&#x201d; Used consistently over time, it can restore credibility to grades by demonstrating and making transparent to all stakeholders the learning outcomes that students achieve.<br><br>This book features many examples of courses that faculty have adapted to spec grading and lays out the surprisingly simple transition process. It is intended for all members of higher education who teach, whatever the discipline and regardless of rank, as well as those who oversee, train, and advise those who teach.<br><br>Specification grading promotes the following values and outcomes. It:<br><br>1. Upholds High Academic Standards<br>2. Reflects Student Attainment of Skills and Knowledge <br>3. Motivates Students to Learn and to Excel<br>4. Fosters Higher-Order Cognitive Development and Creativity<br>5. Discourages Cheating<br>6. Reduces Student Stress<br>7. Makes Students Feel Responsible for Their Grades<br>8. Minimizes Conflict Between Faculty and Students<br>9. Saves Faculty Time and Is Simple to Administer<br>10. Makes Expectations Clear and Simplifies Feedback for Improvement<br>11. Assesses Authentically<br>12. Achieves High Inter-Rater Agreement</p><p>Linda B. Nilson now retired, directed three faculty development centers at major research universities during her 28-year career. She also authored several books: <i>Teaching at Its Best: A Research-Based Resource for College Instructors</i> (2016), now in its fourth edition, <i>The Graphic Syllabus and the Outcomes Map: Communicating Your Course</i> (2007), <i>Creating Self-Regulated Learners: Strategies to Strengthen Students&#x2019; Self-Awareness and Learning Skills</i> (2013), <i>Specifications Grading: Restoring Rigor, Motivating Students, and Saving Faculty Time</i> (2015), and, with Ludwika A.

Stanny is the Director, Center for University Teaching, Learning, and Assessment, and Associate Professor, Department of Psychology, University of West Florida&#x201c;As an undergraduate, I often thought, &#x2018;After this course is over, I will learn the material,&#x2019; feeling that traditional grading got in the way of my learning. Specifications Grading offers a practical alternative that increases student motivation to learn, self-direction, and mastery, while reducing grading time, grade grubbing, and student anger at constructive criticism. With myriad examples throughout, Specs Grading demonstrates how to make grading learning-centered, aligned with student-achieved learning outcomes, and civil.&#x201d; (Cynthia G. Desrochers 2014-09-01)<br><br>&#x201c;Linda Nilson has created a compelling and inclusive justification for how we got to where we are and what does not work with our current approach to grading. She paints a promising vision for our pathways into a future in which learning can become the real measure of academic currency.&#x201d; (Sally M. Johnstone, Vice President for Academic Advancement 2014-09-01)<br><br>"What a ridiculously simple yet profound plan for achieving what Nilson purports. Imagine, students demonstrating mastery of skill for a grade! Students taking back ownership of their progress! Students becoming our clients rather than our customers! Specs Grading, get ready to sashay in and partner up with the outcomes that grades should really reflect." (Carol Washburn EdD, Senior Instructional Designer, Manager, Teaching &amp; Learning 2014-08-01)<br><br>"This book will change your life! Every instructor should buy it now. Nilson shows us how to make grading easier, more logical, and more consonant with research on learning and motivation. A practical, time-saving, student-motivating system of grading. A major advance in our thinking about how we grade and how students learn." (Barbara Walvoord 2014-07-01)<br><br>&#x201c;Faculty who struggle with the challenges of managing time for grading student work and collecting meaningful assessment data from assignments and projects embedded in their courses will find much to interest them in <i>Specifications Grading</i>. Nilson proposes a new approach to rubrics that simplifies the task of grading, maintains standards for consistency and validity of assessments, and aligns grades with specific learning outcomes.<br><br>Specifications grading addresses a question that has long puzzled faculty: Why aren&#x2019;t the grades earned by students accepted as assessments of student learning? <br><br>Nilson presents models for grading assignments and models for combining assignments within a course to document the degree to which students attain competencies expected of all students in the course. She describes class grading structures that enable faculty to create learning-centered learning environments that motivate students, document student attainment of intended learning outcomes, and generate a traditional range of grades to recognize and document the achievements of students who exceed learning expectations for the course.&#x201d; (Claudia J. Stanny 2014-07-01)<br><br>"Time is precious, and achieving high academic standards is essential for our students. Linda Nilson has given us a thorough review of grading practices and created spec grading, which holds promise both for saving some time for faculty and students and for elevating our standards for student learning outcomes. Brava!" (Trudy W. Banta, Professor of Higher Education, Senior Advisor to the Chancellor for Academic Planning and Evaluation 2014-07-01)<br><br>&#x201c;Her latest book, <i>Specifications Grading: Restoring Rigor, Motivating Students, and Saving Faculty Time</i>, is maybe the most innovative, provocative, and potentially revolutionary one she&#x2019;s done.<br><br>Therefore I&#x2019;m making a commitment to dropping traditional grading systems cold-turkey and adopting specs grading in both my classes next semester. Those classes are well-suited for this system: a second-semester abstract algebra course, and the second semester of Discrete Structures for Computer Science. I don&#x2019;t know exactly how it&#x2019;s going to look yet or how it&#x2019;s going to work. But I think I need to do this, if I want to have the kind of classes to which I aspire and which I want to provide for my students.&#x201d; (Robert Talbert, &#x201c;Casting Out 9s&#x201d; blog, Chronicle of Higher Education)</p><h2>Mirette on the High Wire</h2><p>One day, a mysterious stranger arrives at a boardinghouse of the widow Gateau&#x2014;a sad-faced stranger, who keeps to himself.

But do they know that God&#x2019;s presence in the Eucharist is miraculous?</p> <p><i>Heavenly Hosts</i> presents documented Eucharistic miracles in story form to bring middle-grade readers to a better understanding of the Real Presence. One story details a fourth-century priest in the Sahara Desert who loses his faith until the Christ Child appears in the Host; this miraculous sighting causes the priest to return to God. In another tale, Antonio, a ninth-century altar boy, stands firm in a test of faith and is rewarded for his fidelity. And in one memorable story in Italy, a thirteenth-century debate over the true nature of the Eucharist is settled when a donkey falls to its knees before a monstrance containing the consecrated Host. </p> These stories and more&#x2014;including a tale involving the future pope Francis&#x2014;demonstrate God&#x2019;s involvement in the lives of Catholics throughout the centuries, including today. Through these miraculous accounts set in various historical times and places, your children will discover a new appreciation for the Eucharist and its illustration of God&#x2019;s love for those who follow Him. Heavenly Hosts is an essential book for all Catholic families. Saint Pope John Paul II called for us to "rekindle Eucharistic amazement" in the New Evangelization.

The program outlined in this book will reduce anxiety and distress, teaching readers to face memories of trauma while processing their emotions about the event using a scientifically tested and proven technique called Prolonged Exposure Therapy. Instead of avoiding or escaping situations that provoke anxiety and other negative emotions, readers will learn how to reevaluate feelings and beliefs to think differently about their traumatic experiences.

A free eBook version is available at the author's web site.) It's been said that cancer is a fungus. If so, then the cure should be as simple as pH correction with baking soda, the same remedy to remove fungus from plants. While the verdict is still out that cancer is a fungus, here is indisputable proof that some common fungi, found in foods and certain pharmaceuticals, cause cancer. This is a two-part book by the investigative team who delivered, "How Statin Drugs Really Lower Cholesterol (And Kill You One Cell at a Time)". In Part One, you will discover how fungal toxins (and drugs made from fungal toxins) interrupt normal cell replication and lead to cancer. In Part Two, the current Dark Age of medicine is unveiled with light shed on the process that keeps both patients and physicians in the blind about the causes and cures for cancer. What makes life a joy is quality of life &#x2013; a bright facile mind and a healthy body. This book will give you the simple information you need to live long, prosper and never fear the word "cancer" again!</p><p></p><h2>The Black Lizard and Beast in the Shadows</h2><p>Two Golden Age classics from Japan&#39;s grand master of mystery. Edogawa Rampo (pseudonym of Hirai Taro, 1894-1965) is the acknowledged grand master of Japan&#39;s golden age of crime and mystery fiction. In the early part of his career, he created the Japanese gothic mystery, developing the work of Edgar Allan Poe and related nineteenth century writers in a distinctly Japanese form. This part of his career coincided with a great flowering in Japanese literature and culture, a relatively free and uninhibited popular press being a defining feature of the times. In this context, Rampo&#39;s dark vision and extravagant grotesquery found an avid readership, and had a profound influence on other writers. The Black Lizard, a master criminal as deadly as she is beautiful, wagers all in an epic battle with a master detective. A mystery writer vows to protect the woman he secretly loves from the Beast in the Shadows, but disaster strikes when he turns detective himself.</p><p>Edogawa Rampo (pseudonym of Hirai Taro, 1894-1965) is the acknowledged grand master of Japan's golden age of crime and mystery fiction. In the early part of his career, he created the Japanese gothic mystery, developing the work of Edgar Allan Poe and related nineteenth century writers in a distinctly Japanese form. This part of his career coincided with a great flowering in Japanese literature and culture, a relatively free and uninhibited popular press being a defining feature of the times. In this context, Rampo's dark vision and extravagant grotesquery found an avid readership, and had a profound influence on other writers. Public morals tightened in the years leading up to Japan's Asian and Pacific wars, and censorship was tight in the war years. Rampo's early work fell out of favour, and he turned to adventure stories with detective characters in leading roles. After the war, he concentrated on stories for young readers, and on developing the Japan Association of Mystery Writers. The Edogawa Rampo Prize, originally endowed by Rampo himself, is awarded annually to the finest work of the year in the mystery genre. It is the most important prize of its type in Japan. Edogawa Rampo -- whose name is meant to be read as a punning reference to 'Edgar Allan Poe' -- remains popular and influential in Japan. His work remains in print, in various different editions, and his stories provide the background for a steady stream of film, television, and theatrical adaptations. <p>Kurodahan Press takes great pleasure in presenting the first English language translations of these two short novels. We hope to bring more of Edogawa Rampo's unique brand of crime fiction to life in English, and there is no better place to start than in the cavernous hideaway of the Black Lizard.</p></p><h2>The Curse of the Self: Self-Awareness, Egotism, and the Quality of Human Life</h2><p>Despite its obvious advantages, our ability to be self-reflective comes at a high price. Few people realize how profoundly their lives are affected by self-reflection or how frequently inner chatter interferes with their success, pollutes their relationships with others, and undermines their happiness. By allowing people to ruminate about the past or imagine what might happen in the future, self-reflection conjures up a great deal of personal suffering in the form of depression, anxiety, anger, jealousy, and other negative emotions. A great deal of unhappiness, in the form of addictions, overeating, and domestic violence, is due to people's inability to exert control over their thoughts and behavior. Is it possible to direct our self-reflection in a way that will minimize the disadvantages and maximize the advantages? Is there a way to affect the egotistical self through self-reflection? In this volume, Mark Leary explores the personal and social problems that are created by the capacity for self-reflection, and by drawing upon psychology and other behavioral sciences, offers insights into how these problems can be minimized.<br></p><p><br><strong>Mark R. Leary</strong> is Professor of Psychology at Duke University. He is a fellow of the American Psychological Association and the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, and former president of the International Society for Self and Identity. He was named by the Institute for Scientific Information as among the 25 most productive scholars in psychology (1986-1990).<br><br>"Get ready to drop your ego and step into the real world. If you ever wanted to know why everybody else always seems one step removed from reality - Beware - Leary's well researched deadly accurate book, proves once and for all that the common denominator in all your failed relationships is you!

Leary is clearly an expert on the topic-I doubt you would find anyone better qualified to write this book." -Roy Baumeister, Professor, Department of Psychology, Florida State University<p></p><br>"Many years ago Whitney Houston sang that the greatest love of all was love for the self. She wouldn't feel that way if she read Mark Leary's refreshing and provocative analysis of how our 'selves' cause many of our greatest disasters and disappointments. Ironically, this book generates considerable introspection, even as it provides inspiration for learning not to let our selves get in the way of healthful and meaningful living." -Todd F. Heatherton, Champion International Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Dartmouth College<p></p><br>"<em>The Curse of the Self</em> is a thinking person's self-help book, not in the trivial, superficial sense in which the term 'self-help book' is usually used, but in the sense of being both intellectually stimulating and offering useful, practical advice and insights." -Lee Jussim, Department of Psychology, Rutgers University<p></p><br></p><h2>The Mathematics of Turfgrass Maintenance</h2><p>Loaded with helpful hints and easy-to-understand examples -- and now with 20 percent more content -- this book covers the type of mathematical problems that golf course superintendents face every day.

Dan Madsen describes the Navy's dramatic race to clear the harbor and repair as many ships as possible so they could return to the fleet ready for war. Numerous photographs, many never before published in books for the general public, give readers a real appreciation for the momentous task involved, from the raising of the USS <i>Oglala</i> in 1942 and the USS <i>Oklahoma</i> in 1943 to the eventual dismantling of the above-water portions of the USS <i>Arizona</i>.</p><p>Daniel Madsen is also the author of <i>Forgotten Fleet: The Mothball Navy</i>.

York (1887&#x2013;1964)&#x2015;devout Christian, conscientious objector, and reluctant hero of World War I&#x2015;is one of America's most famous and celebrated soldiers. Known to generations through Gary Cooper's Academy Award-winning portrayal in the 1941 film <i>Sergeant York</i>, York is credited with the capture of 132 German soldiers on October 8, 1918, in the Meuse-Argonne region of France&#x2015;a deed for which he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.<br><br>At war's end, the media glorified York's bravery but some members of the German military and a soldier from his own unit cast aspersions on his wartime heroics. Historians continue to debate whether York has received more recognition than he deserves. A fierce disagreement about the location of the battle in the Argonne forest has further complicated the soldier's legacy.<br><br>In <i>Alvin York</i>, Douglas V. Mastriano sorts fact from myth in the first full-length biography of York in decades. He meticulously examines York's youth in the hills of east Tennessee, his service in the Great War, and his return to a quiet civilian life dedicated to charity. By reviewing artifacts recovered from the battlefield using military terrain analysis, forensic study, and research in both German and American archives, Mastriano reconstructs the events of October 8 and corroborates the recorded accounts. On the eve of the WWI centennial, <i>Alvin York</i> promises to be a major contribution to twentieth-century military history.</p><p><b>Douglas V.

Through her eyes, rocks convey faith, ponds preach stillness, flowers give love, and leaves express the effortless ease of letting go. The book welcomes readers into the garden for Zen lessons in fearlessness, forgiveness, presence, acceptance, and contentment. Miller gathers inspiration from the ground beneath her feet to remind us that paradise is always here and now.</p><p><b>Karen Maezen Miller</b> is a Zen Buddhist priest and teacher at the Hazy Moon Zen Center in Los Angeles. The author of <i>Hand Wash Cold</i> and <i>Momma Zen</i>, she leads retreats around the country.<b>Chapter 16:<br>Weeds A flourishing practice </b><br><br><i>Empty handed, holding a hoe. Mahasattva Fu</i><br><br> Paradise is a patch of weeds.<br><br> What loyal friends, these undesirables that infiltrate the lawn, insinuate between cracks, and luxuriate in the deep shade of my neglect. Weeds are everywhere, showing up every day. I have quite a bit of help around here but weeds are my most reliable underlings. Where would I be without them? I would run out of reasons to wake up every morning. I would lack motivation and direction. I might consider the job here to be done.<br><br> The job here is just beginning.<br><br> As if it isn&#x2019;t obvious enough, I must confess that in these sixteen years of gardening I have not yet learned how to garden. Oops! By this I mean that I do not know the chemistry of soils or the biology of compost. I have not learned the nomenclature; I do not know the right time or way to prune. My most useful tools are the ones farthest from my hands: sun and water. I have not planted a single thing still standing. In all this time in the yard I have cultivated no worthwhile skills, save one that is decidedly unskilled.<br><br> I weed.<br><br> I offer this up as a modest qualification because I have noticed how reluctantly most people bring themselves to the task. Weeding is not a popular pastime, even among gardeners. Weeds are the very emblem of aversion. Weeding doesn&#x2019;t produce a rewarding outcome. No grand finale, no big reveal. There&#x2019;s absolutely nothing to show for it. One spring I directed our revered Mr. Isobe to a troublesome spot in the backyard where invasives were spreading through the mondo grass. He squinted to see what I was pointing to. Subsequently he did not share my distress, but broke into laughter. You want me to weed?&#x201d; Perhaps he couldn&#x2019;t believe that someone of his stature would be asked to stoop to the occasion. Or perhaps I was just imagining what he meant. In any event, I was offended, and I didn&#x2019;t ask him again. The weeds were all mine.<br><br> While I was casting about for something to do for the rest of my life, as we like to characterize temporary forms of employment, I hit upon a scheme. I&#x2019;d seen how common it was for an otherwise respectable yard to be surrendered over to wilderness for the lack of a spade. And the worse it got, the worse it gets. I suggested to my husband that I start an enterprise not for landscape design or decoration, for which I was unsuited but just to weed. I would call it Just Weeds.&#x201d; I would go over to people&#x2019;s houses every week and just pull weeds probably weeds they didn&#x2019;t even know they had! I thought it was inspired, but he thought it was lame. So instead I do it every day for no pay. This is how your life becomes rich with purpose. You take care of things that lie right under your feet, and no one even notices.<br><br> The most common weeds in the yard are crabgrass, dandelion, and chickweed. The most common weeds in the world are greed, anger, and ignorance.<br><br> This is the way to weed. Anchor yourself low to the ground so you can get a good look at what you&#x2019;re dealing with. Use a spade to loosen the hardpack and go deeper. The next part is tricky. Take hold of the stem and apply your attention, allowing the root to release. Haste and carelessness will only aggravate the situation. Sometimes you can get the root on the first tug. Other times you&#x2019;ll just tear off the top. Even if you don&#x2019;t get it all the first time, that&#x2019;s okay. It may take two or three, ten or twenty, one hundred thousand million times, to get the root completely. Just keep going along like that, encountering the next weed that appears in front of you for the rest of your life.<br><br> <br><br> <b>Ten things to do to spare the garden from stubborn entanglements: </b><br><br> 1. <b>Blame no one.</b> I could blame the yardman for the weeds. Or everyone who ever let them fester. The folks who aren&#x2019;t around for what they haven&#x2019;t done. The sun, the dirt, the wind, the seed, the rain, and the shade. But what does any of that matter when the spade is in my hands? Blame&#x2019;s central deceit is that anyone or anything else is responsible for what I think, feel, say and do. Blame is a powerful barrier: like prickly thistle, it spreads pain and disaffection. So why toss fault around? To elevate my ego and justify my self-righteousness, that&#x2019;s why. Watch that you do not become attached to your version of events. Blame turns the garden into a menace.<br><br> 2. <b>Take no offense.</b> But I&#x2019;m so good at it! And usually, offended by what someone doesn&#x2019;t even know they did. That&#x2019;s because offense is an inside job. It requires that we ascribe malice and meaning to empty words or actions. Consider the energy we expend to prolong fictional injuries. How hard is it to get over what&#x2019;s already over? I know: it&#x2019;s hard. But there&#x2019;s a way.<br><br> 3. <b>Forgive.</b> Forgiveness is the cure. Without it, we sell the farm under our feet, subdividing common ground into stingy little parcels that are good for nothing. Forgiveness reconciles the rift between self and other. Like property lines, the barrier between us doesn&#x2019;t really exist except as a function of greed, anger, or judgment. Forgive someone today forgive yourself today and feel the fence lines recede. Suddenly, it&#x2019;s much easier to move on.<br><br> 4. <b>Do not compare.</b> There is no greener grass. There is no other side. Your life is not a competition, race or a chase. No one is ahead of you, and there is no way to fall behind. Satisfy yourself with what you have in hand. It may not look like much, but this right here is everything. And, it&#x2019;s alive.<br><br> 5. <b>Take off your gloves.</b> A nurseryman once told me, A real gardener doesn&#x2019;t wear gloves.&#x201d; A gardener wears dirt, unafraid to get muddy, scratched, or stung, because hands are how we see, hear, and feel. Native intelligence flows through your fingertips, wisdom received in direct connection with the world, telling you know how deep to dig and how hard to pull, when to gather and when to release. Self-defenses make you timid and clumsy. You can do without the layers of protection.<br><br> 6. <b>Forget yourself.</b> The world needs a few less people to own their own greatness and few more to own their own humility. So let&#x2019;s stop pretending. We are never really who we think we are, nor are we anywhere close to the ideal we strive for. My neighbors down the street installed expensive artificial turf on a strip of yard closest to the street. It&#x2019;s an uncanny likeness. Each blade is a uniform height and color, so it never needs to be watered or cut. It passes as grass from a distance, but up close you can tell it&#x2019;s not real. Worse yet, weeds still crop up through the weave, and they are even harder to get rid of. When you can face reality without camouflage, yours is the face of compassion. What a sight for sore eyes! No longer obsessed with your self-image, you become genuine. Barefaced and open, your smile is easy; your eyes, wide and bright. Nothing is beneath or beyond you. You can do the smallest things. You carry peace wherever you go and share it with everyone, mindful that we&#x2019;re all doing our best, and headed in the same direction.<br><br> 7.<b> Grow old.</b> It isn&#x2019;t easy, it&#x2019;s effortless.<br><br> 8. <b>Have no answers. </b>If, as the ancients say, we are born and die six billion times a day; if, according to modern science, fifty million cells in your body will replace themselves in the time you read this sentence, do you really have an answer for anything? In Zen, we don&#x2019;t find the answers; we lose the questions. It&#x2019;s impossible to comprehend the marvel of what we are, or to understand the mystery of life&#x2019;s impeccable genius. Thankfully, there is no need. You don&#x2019;t have to know how your heart beats so you can get your mitral valve to open. You don&#x2019;t have to ace Anatomy 101 to move your arms and feet. The state of not-knowing does not imply a lack of learning, it is the totality of truth. You&#x2019;re already real, genuine, and functioning perfectly as you are. Weed out the confusion that comes from trying to understand. Don&#x2019;t think, and you will be grateful.<br><br> 9. <b>Seek nothing. </b> All who seek suffer,&#x201d; Buddhism teaches. If there is no seeking, only then is there bliss.&#x201d; That gives you a pretty clear picture of where the suffering begins and ends. Just for one moment take my word that you lack nothing. That you&#x2019;re perfectly okay even when you&#x2019;re not okay. If you&#x2019;ve recognized something in these pages you want to underline and remember, it&#x2019;s because you already know it. Have faith in yourself as the Way.<br><br> 10. <b>Go back to 1.</b> The Buddha is still refining his practice.<br><br> <br><br> The old teachers called them sweet grasses,&#x201d; the overgrowth that beckons from the side of the road. Dense and shimmery, they are eye candy to the weary pilgrim, but poisonous. Wander close and they&#x2019;ll make you sick. Let me chew on this for awhile anger, blame, guilt let me hide out in those brambles fear and worry let me lie down and go to sleep rumination and make-believe so I don&#x2019;t have to keep going. The path leads on. There&#x2019;s no end in sight. You can only see what&#x2019;s right in front of you. The scenery may not seem interesting or the time, productive. You get bored and look around for, well, something.<br><br> Shouldn&#x2019;t I be making progress? Going faster? Accomplishing more? Getting somewhere? Surely there&#x2019;s more to this trip than one measly breath at a time, one lousy foot in front of the other? I don&#x2019;t see what&#x2019;s so special about it.<br><br> We can lose our lives in these sidetracks: dwelling on the past and anticipating the future; judging, resisting and debating with ourselves; falling again for the familiar ruts. To be fair, poison ivy isn&#x2019;t all bad: its berries feed foraging birds and wildlife. But by all means you don&#x2019;t want to tromp around in it. In tiny doses, hemlock is medicinal. But don&#x2019;t make a meal of it.<br><br> When folks begin to practice, they can be set back by how hard it is. They might have expected to be good at it for certain they expected something but what they are good at is something else altogether.<br><br> Why is it so hard to just breathe? Because you&#x2019;ve been practicing holding your breath.<br><br> Why is it so hard to keep my eyes open?<i> Because you&#x2019;ve been practicing falling asleep.</i><br><br> Why is it so hard to be still? <i>Because you&#x2019;ve been practicing running amok.</i><br><br> Why is it so hard to be quiet? <i>Because you&#x2019;ve been practicing talking to yourself.</i><br><br> Why is it so hard to pay attention? <i>Because you&#x2019;ve been practicing inattention.</i><br><br> Why is it so hard to relax? <i>Because you&#x2019;ve been practicing stress.</i><br><br> Why is it so hard to trust? <i>Because you&#x2019;ve been practicing fear.</i><br><br> Why is it so hard to have faith? <i>Because you&#x2019;ve been trying to know.</i><br><br> Why is it so hard to feel good? <i>Because you&#x2019;ve been practicing feeling bad.</i><br><br> Whatever you practice, you&#x2019;ll get very good at, and you&#x2019;ve been practicing these things forever. Take your own life as proof that practice works as long as you keep doing it. Just replace a harmful practice with one that does no harm.<br><br> The desperate traveler keeps going, and a change takes place. The landscape transforms from a jungle pocked with toxins into an open field. The interruptions are fewer; the diversions, farther between. The sweet grasses are left behind. The field is one we cultivate step by step: swinging breath like a hoe to clear the surface of mind, using samadhi like a spade to go deeper. What does it take to turn a pit of poison into paradise? We can say we know, but we still have to do it over and over again, and never quit.<br><br> After practicing <i>shikantaza,</i> just sitting, for forty years, Maezumi Roshi said,<br><br> I think I&#x2019;m beginning to do it.&#x201d;<br><br> Every time I step into the garden, I&#x2019;ve landed my dream job. Only it&#x2019;s not called Just Weeds.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s just weeds, the business of a buddha. I think I&#x2019;m beginning to do it.<br></p><h2>Religion in 5 Minutes</h2><p>Religion in Five Minutes provides an accessible and lively introduction to the questions about religion and religious behaviour that interest most of us, whether or not we personally identify with - or practice - a religion.

In this best&#x2013;selling classic,A.W. Pink answers such profound questions in a language the average Christian layperson will find not only understandable but totally engaging. Pink, one of the most influential evangelical authors of the last century, writes with fiery passion and brilliant clarity, giving biblical answers to our deepest questions regarding the<br>sadly neglected and little understood doctrine of the sovereignty of God.</p><p>Arthur Walkington Pink (1886-1952) was an evangelist and biblical scholar known for Calvinist and Puritan teachings. Born in England, Pink became a Christian in his early 20&#39;s and immigrated to the United States to study at Moody Bible Institute. After marrying in 1916 he went on to pastor churches in Australia and England before returning to the U. S. to pastor churches in Colorado, California, Kentucky, and South Carolina. Pink returned to England in 1934, turning his Christian service to writing books and pamphlets. After Pink&#39;s death, his works were republished by the Banner of Truth Trust and reached a much wider audience as a result, making him one of the most influential evangelical authors in the second half of the twentieth century. His writing sparked a revival of expository preaching and focused readers&#39; hearts on biblical living. His works include numerous Bible studies and books such as &#34;The Attibrutes of God,&#34; &#34;The Doctrine of Justification,&#34; &#34;The Patience of God,&#34;and &#34;The Total Depravity of Man.&#34;</p><h2>The Reading Promise: My Father and the Books We Shared</h2><p>When Alice Ozma was in 4th grade, she and her father decided to see if he could read aloud to her for 100 consecutive nights. On the hundreth night, they shared pancakes to celebrate, but it soon became evident that neither wanted to let go of their storytelling ritual. So they decided to continue what they called "The Streak." Alice's father read aloud to her every night without fail until the day she left for college. <br><br> Alice approaches her book as a series of vignettes about her relationship with her father and the life lessons learned from the books he read to her.<br><br>Books included in the Streak were: <em>Great Expectations</em> by Charles Dickens, the Oz books by L. Frank Baum, <em>Harry Potter</em> by J. K. Rowling, <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em> by Lewis Carroll, and Shakespeare's plays.<br><br><i>*Includes reading group guide*</i><br></p><p>Alice Ozma, a recent Rowan University graduate, currently lives in the Rittenhouse Square area of Philadelphia, PA. She is passionate about literature, education, and working with children. Find out more about this author by visiting her website: www.makeareadingpromise.com.Named for two literary characters ("Alice" from Lewis Carroll and "Ozma" from L. Frank Baum), the author is the daughter of a Philadelphia-area elementary school librarian. Father and daughter embarked on a streak of reading-out-loud sessions every night before bed as Ozma was growing up. At first they decided on 100 nights straight of reading before bed&#x2014;a minimum 10 minutes, before midnight, every night, no exceptions&#x2014;then it stretched to 1,000, and soon enough the author was headed to college and they had spent eight years straight reading before bedtime, from Oz stories to Shakespeare. Reading with her father offered a comforting continuity in the midst of her mother's disquieting move away from the family, her older sister's absence as a foreign exchange student, and the parsimoniousness of her single father. Ozma's account percolates chronologically through her adolescence, as father and daughter persevered in their streak of nightly reading despite occasional inconveniences such as coming home late, sleepovers (they read over the phone), and a rare case of the father's laryngitis. Ozma's work is humorous, generous, and warmly felt, and with a terrific reading list included, there is no better argument for the benefits of reading to a child than this rich, imaginative work.

Now, he tackles the mind&#x2019;s role in the most difficult aspect of golfing&#x2014;the short game.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s no secret that more than two-thirds of the shots a golfer makes are short ones: putts, chips, and pitches. Long drives may garner applause, but whether a golfer wants to win the Masters or just five bucks from a friend on Saturday morning, it&#x2019;s the little shots that make the difference. Yet many players either fail to recognize or choose to ignore the importance of the short game. In <i>The Unstoppable Golfer, </i>Dr. Rotella applies the same wisdom and experience that have worked for clients like Davis Love III and Graeme McDowell to help every golfer master this special art of short shots and take all the frustration out of this increasingly challenging element of the game.<br> <br>Requiring extraordinary levels of concentration, the short game is typically a source of fear for amateurs and pros alike. In this book, Dr. Rotella teaches readers how to overcome that fear by using their minds to achieve a state of calm in which the focus is on one thing alone: the hole. Rotella shares stories about professionals with whom he has worked who have mastered the psychological aspect of successful putting by adhering to simple&#x2014;but hard-to-follow&#x2014;rules and practices that will improve any golfer&#x2019;s game: stay focused on your targets, visualize your shots, commit to your routine, and accept completely whatever happened to the golf ball.<br> <br>On top of citing his experiences with golfers, Dr. Rotella also probes the science of memory and how knowledge of the brain&#x2019;s workings&#x2014;especially those areas that deal with physical tasks&#x2014;can markedly improve a golf game, particularly when it comes to getting out of a bunker or taking the measure of a long putt. For casual and dedicated golfers alike, a better short game provides one of the ultimate pleasures of golf&#x2014;a pleasure they will come to know by training their minds to allow them to become unstoppable golfers.<br> <br>Since 1984, golfers coached by Dr. Bob Rotella have won a total of:<br> <br>-74 major professional titles 2 Masters tournaments<br> <br>-12 U.S. Opens<br> <br>-12 British Opens<br> <br>-11 PGA Championships<br> <br>-4 U.S. Women&#x2019;s Opens<br> <br>-6 LPGA Championships<br> <br>-5 Kraft-Nabisco Championships<br> <br>-5 Tradition Championships<br> <br>-7 Women&#x2019;s British Opens<br> <br>-2 Senior PGA Championships<br> <br>-5 U.S. Senior Opens<br> <br>-3 Senior Players Championships</p><p>Dr. Bob Rotella<b> </b>was the director of sports psychology for twenty years at the University of Virginia, where his reputation grew as the person champions talked to about the mental aspects of their game.

If I didn&#x2019;t already know this, I could learn it every April at the Masters.<br> <br>In the popular mind, Augusta National Golf Club may be a course that Bob Jones and Alister MacKenzie designed to favor the heroic long hitter, a Sam Snead when the Masters began or a Bubba Watson today. And there&#x2019;s certainly nothing wrong with hitting the ball a long way, especially if a golfer hits it where he&#x2019;s aiming. Only a fool would say he&#x2019;d rather not drive the ball 330 yards into the middle of every fairway.<br> <br>But I&#x2019;ve seen lots of players who can drive the ball 330 yards and yet have never won a Masters, or even come close. Augusta National tests their short games and finds them wanting.<br> <br>All the grass on and around Augusta&#x2019;s greens is mowed closer than the hair on the head of a boot-camp marine. The greens are so quick that inexperienced players can and do putt right off of them. And the putts on the greens are not nearly as testing as the pitches around them. From grass so short that most golf clubs would be happy to call them putting surfaces, players have to hit pitches and lobs that fly precise distances at precise trajectories and then either check up or roll out, depending on the circumstances. Moreover, the grounds crew at Augusta generally mows so that the golfer has to chip and pitch into the grain of the grass, adding another layer of complexity for the elite player.<br> <br>These conditions expose a lot of doubt and fear. No one gets invited to the Masters unless he is an accomplished player. But I have had Masters contestants come up to me in the days before the tournament begins and say, &#x201c;No way am I getting in the hunt this week, Doc. I am not going to pitch the ball from around these greens on national television.&#x201d;<br> <br>That&#x2019;s an extreme example of the debilitating fear that can infect a golfer&#x2019;s short game. At other times, the effect is more subtle.<br> <br>A young player I work with was thrilled one year to be invited to his first Masters. For the most part, he played very well, but he missed the cut by a stroke or two. One of his playing partners during the first two rounds sent me a message about my client. The message was: &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a good kid and a good player. But he needs to be able to hit a high, soft lob off a tight lie.&#x201d;<br> <br>The truth was, my young client could hit a high, soft lob off a tight lie. But when he got to the Masters for the first time, he felt a sudden flash of doubt when the need for that shot arose, as it inevitably did. Mentally, he wasn&#x2019;t quite ready to play the short game that Augusta National demands. He played other kinds of shots in those situations, shots from a ball position closer to his right foot, so he could be confident of striking the ball cleanly. They probably looked quite decent to the average spectator, but these shots too often didn&#x2019;t get him close enough to the hole to save par or make birdie.<br> <br>Physically, he was ready to play in the Masters. He had the skills. But my client still had work to do to develop the mental side of his short game. He had, quite understandably, felt a little bit in awe of the Masters. That had caused him to start to feel that he had to be able to hit perfect shots to compete there. He forgot that on lots of very good golf courses, he&#x2019;d won because he&#x2019;d trusted his skills and let himself find a way to get the ball in the hole.<br> <br>The player who wins at Augusta loves the way the course challenges his short game. He loves showing off his skills. He loves knowing that his short game will separate him from many of the other contestants.<br> <br>Trevor Immelman, who won the Masters in 2008, is a perfect example. Trevor learned the short game very naturally, the way I would hope any kid would learn it. He has a brother, Mark, who&#x2019;s nine years older and himself a very good golfer (and now the coach at Columbus State University in Georgia). Mark took up the game at fourteen, when he enrolled at a school called Hottentot Holland High School in the Immelmans&#x2019; hometown of Somerset West, South Africa. Trevor, who was five, tried desperately to keep up with Mark and his friends. Obviously, he couldn&#x2019;t hit the ball as far as his older brother. Out of necessity, he learned to hit pitches close to the hole and to putt well.<br> <br>The boys&#x2019; father, Johan, responded to his sons&#x2019; passion for golf by building a rudimentary putting green with a sand bunker in the family&#x2019;s front yard. Neither Johan nor Mark had to force Trevor to use the green. Trevor&#x2019;s competitive instincts got him started. He remembers that sometimes he would practice his chips, pitches, and putts for hours at a time. Sometimes he would do it in spurts, practicing for fifteen or twenty minutes, then going back inside the house and watching television. Eventually, he expanded his horizons, hitting pitches to the green from neighbors&#x2019; lawns. Some of them were a full wedge away and Trevor learned to hit over trees and walls. (Somerset West must have been a kind and tolerant community.)<br> <br>He did not take a lot of formal lessons. Instead, he learned by watching better players, beginning with Mark. He asked questions. He started watching professionals on South Africa&#x2019;s tour. Ernie Els, for example, showed Trevor how he used the bounce on his wedges.<br> <br>In 1998, when he was eighteen, Trevor came to America and won the U.S. Public Links championship, which carried with it an invitation to the 1999 Masters. He remembers being dazzled and intimidated that year by the speed of the Augusta greens and their slopes. But right away, he felt confident about his pitching and chipping capabilities. Trevor also could see that the best players at the Masters knew where to put the ball on those complex greens. They gave themselves putts they could hit confidently.<br> <br>When he returned to the Masters as a professional some years later, Trevor set about mastering the subtleties of those greens. His strong short game gave him an edge at Augusta, and he had a sixth-place finish to his credit when he returned for the Masters of 2008. But he was on almost no one&#x2019;s short list of favorites. He had to deal with an additional irritant that year when his swing coach decided not to go to Augusta. I told Trevor that the same thing had happened to Tom Kite in 1992 at the U.S. Open in Pebble Beach. It hadn&#x2019;t proven to be an insurmountable problem&#x2014;Tom won.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s decide it&#x2019;s going to help,&#x201d; I said to Trevor. &#x201c;Your job is to find a way to play great golf even if your coach doesn&#x2019;t come. Just get into trusting your golf swing and playing golf.&#x201d;<br> <br>Trevor had, by then, developed a very smart game plan for playing Augusta, particularly the two pivotal par fives on the second nine, Nos. 13 and 15. The plan depended on his confidence with his wedges. Basically, he decided that on those two holes, he would try to reach the green in two shots only if he had a 4-iron or less for his second shot. Otherwise, he would lay up and rely on his short game.<br> <br>The plan was more complicated than that, of course. The spot from which he wanted to hit his wedges to each hole varied with the possible hole locations. For some locations, he might want a high shot with lots of backspin that hit the green and spun back. That would dictate a lay-up to a certain yardage. For others, he might want a lower pitch that bounced once and then checked. That might dictate a different yardage or a different angle.<br> <br>Not every player would, or could, formulate such a plan. As I&#x2019;ve said, there are contestants at the Masters who fear and avoid the shots Trevor was putting into his game plan. But the history of the Masters, while it has its share of long hitters, also shows that the short game can be the key to success. Recent winners like Mike Weir and Zach Johnson were not overly long. Past champions like the Spaniards Seve Ballesteros and Jos� Maria Olaz�bal were geniuses with their wedges. Tom Kite had always shown well at Augusta.<br> <br>Trevor, I thought, had that kind of short game. More important, he had precisely the attitude toward his short game that I love to see in a player. It was an attitude that would help him regardless of the shot he was hitting. If a golfer has confidence in his short game&#x2014;if he looks forward to opportunities to show it off on the golf world&#x2019;s greatest stage&#x2014;it helps him to accept calmly whatever happens on the course. It relaxes him. No shot, no mistake, is going to upset him. His short game is an emotional shield.<br> <br>Knowing that, it was easy to help Trevor when I talked to him during that week. I simply reminded him to do the same things he always tried to do&#x2014;stay focused on his targets, visualize his shots, commit to his routine, and accept completely whatever happened to the golf ball. They&#x2019;re simple rules, Trevor says, but they&#x2019;re not easy or simple to follow. It&#x2019;s been my experience that tournament winners, even in major championships, more often than not are people who simply do those things. They stick to their normal routines and fundamentals while other players let the pressure of the moment persuade them to try something different.<br> <br>I recall particularly one shot Trevor hit during that Masters. It came on Saturday at the 13th hole, a hole that Masters winners quite often birdie. Trevor drove the ball superbly all that week, but his tee shot on the 13th left him with more than a 4-iron to the green. So, true to his plan, he laid up to 80 yards. But he still intended to get his birdie.<br> <br>The hole that day was cut in a small plateau on the back-left portion of the green. It&#x2019;s a very demanding spot because the player has maybe six or seven feet of landing area on the plateau. In front of that there&#x2019;s a steep bank. It&#x2019;s very tough to sink a putt from off the plateau because of that bank. But a player can&#x2019;t miss long if he tries to get the ball onto the plateau. The ensuing chip or bunker shot would have little or no chance to stay on the plateau, leading most likely to a two-putt bogey. Most players who lay up at No. 13 when the pin is back-left settle for a par, because their pitch to the green winds up short of the plateau.<br> <br>Trevor&#x2019;s plan was to hit a low pitch into the bank in front of that back plateau. It was a shot that had to be precise, and I suspect that a lot of players would have left it short. But Trevor had been planning for the shot, practicing it on the range and rehearsing it whenever he got to No. 13 during a practice round. His mind was clear and his confidence was high.<br> <br>He relied on his routine. He took his sand wedge from his bag, envisioned the shot he wanted, and struck it crisply. The ball landed in the bank, took one hop up, and settled within tap-in distance of the hole. The crowd erupted in applause. It was as fine a birdie as you will ever see, and it gave Trevor momentum that carried him through to the 54-hole lead.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not easy to play from the lead at the Masters. A player who had never won a major would be inhuman if he didn&#x2019;t find that on Saturday night, he began to think of all the ways in which a victory would change his life. When I visited Trevor that evening, he was nervous. I could only try to help him minimize those thoughts and refocus his attention on the same ideas that helped him birdie the 13th hole and get the 54-hole lead: target, routine, acceptance, commitment. We discussed trying to give each shot the same equal and relatively low emotional weight, staying calm whether the outcome of a stroke was good or bad. When he left the practice green early Sunday afternoon, I gave him a high five and a grin and told him to go get it&#x2014;but to stay in the present moment.<br> <br>Trevor did. He misfired only once that Sunday, when he pulled a 6-iron into the pond left of the 16th green. His short game and his attitude got him through. He didn&#x2019;t know at the time where he stood in the tournament, since he tries to avoid looking at leaderboards. He didn&#x2019;t know whether the Masters was on the line or not. (As it happened, he had a 5-stroke lead.) He responded just as he might have done if he&#x2019;d hit the same shot on Thursday morning, rather than Sunday afternoon. He reminded himself to stay calm. That 6-iron shot was gone, and he had to accept it just as completely as he&#x2019;d accepted the brilliant pitch to the 13th green on Saturday. He dropped a ball on the front of the tee box and relied again on his short game. He hit a 9-iron over the pond, two-putted, and moved on.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t until he had marked his ball on the 18th green that Trevor decided to find out where he stood. He asked his caddie, Neil Wallace.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re three ahead of Woods,&#x201d; Neil informed him.<br> <br>Instantly, Trevor went from having complete peace of mind to wondering how he could avoid five-putting. It was a good lesson for him in staying in the moment. He gathered himself, though, two-putted, and claimed his green jacket.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve coached the winners of 74 major championships on the PGA, LPGA, and Champions tours. Trevor was the first, and to date the only, one who hit the ball extremely well all week long. He was near the top of the driving statistics and the greens-in-regulation figures that week. Even given that, I would say that Trevor&#x2019;s short game and his mastery of those daunting Augusta greens were largely responsible for his victory. The critical role of the short game has been even more apparent with most of the major winners I&#x2019;ve worked with. They have all hit the ball badly at least occasionally during their triumphant weeks. They have won because of their short games, their mental toughness, and the fact that few contenders in big events play their normal games.<br> <br>In fact, most weeks on the PGA Tour, the winner does not win as he might have once dreamed he would. He doesn&#x2019;t hit every fairway, knock every iron shot close, and sink a lot of tap-in birdie putts. Instead, he scrambles and putts well.<br> <br>As I write this, the Tour leader in greens hit in regulation is David Toms, averaging a bit less than 13 greens per round. Tied for 100th are Woody Austin and Steven Bowditch, averaging 11.5 greens in regulation per round. These statistics are typical, though the names change. Almost every player on the PGA Tour hits between 11 and 13 greens per round. What separates the consistent winners from those who struggle to keep their Tour cards? The short game.<br> <br>I see the critical importance of the short game all the more in amateur competition. I work with college players who can hit the ball as well as any professional&#x2014;on their good days. But all days are not good days, particularly for young players. Some days they can&#x2019;t find the fairway. On those days, college players with great short games find a way to scrape the ball around in 70 or 72 strokes. They stay in the tournament. They help their teams. Players without good short games shoot 79 on days when their long game deserts them.<br> <br>The importance of the short game does not diminish as the level of play goes down. On the contrary, average players need a good short more than elite players do. According to the United States Golf Association, the median handicap for American men is about 14. This means that the average club player likely shoots a bit under 90. For women, the median is around 27, which suggests that the average female play...</p><h2>Snip Snap!: What&#39;s That?</h2><p><p><b>snip<br>snap!</b></p><p><b>SNIP<br>SNAP!</b></p><p><b>SNIP<br>SNAP!</b></p><p>What's that?<br>And what will <br>the children do <br>once they find out?</p></p><p><p>Mara Bergman was born in the Bronx and grew up in Wantagh, New York.

In this offbeat fantasy, an alligator makes his way down the street, through the front door, up the stairs, and into an apartment where three children flee from his gaping jaws. Finally, when they have endured the threat--or perhaps enjoyed the thrill--long enough, they turn the tables by yelling at the beast, who runs away. Using elements of rhythm and rhyme as well as an enjoyably predictable question-and-answer refrain, the text maintains a playful tone beneath the scary details such as alligator eyes flashing and teeth gnashing. Expressive line drawings, brightened with watercolor washes, illustrate the story with wit and style. Not for every preschooler, perhaps, but good fun for some, especially those who fantasize that they really <i>could</i> whip an alligator and those who realize that their home will never be invaded by a giant reptile. The final scene, in which the beast escapes into a manhole, might keep the alligators-in-the-sewer urban legend alive for another generation. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Wilson celebrated the misfit not as a figure be "fixed" and reintegrated into society, but as a lone journeyer who often had a stirring artistic, political, or spiritual innovation to convey to society. <br><br>Wilson lived this book as much as wrote it. As an impoverished 23-year-old, the Englishman slept in a tent in a London park so that he could be free of material demands to dedicate himself fully to his study. When The Outsider appeared in 1956, it became a sensation among both critics and beats, who formed the vanguard of the dawning Aquarian Age. <br><br>In Wilson's epic exploration of mystics, visionaries, literary pioneers, political troublemakers, and rule breakers of all sorts, he evoked a new kind of heroism, which changed how we view ourselves and our purpose in life.&nbsp; <br><br><i>The Outsider</i> is now reissued and reset in a beautiful Tarcher Cornerstone Edition, with a new introduction by Wilson's friend and biographer, Gary Lachman. This new volume coincides with Tarcher's publication of Lachman's biography of Wilson, <i>Beyond the Robot.</i></p><p>Born to a working class English household in 1931,<b> Colin Wilson</b> went from being the "bad boy" of the British literary scene to becoming a wide-ranging historian, novelist, critic, and philosopher. In addition to his classic study of rebellion, <i>The Outsider</i>, Wilson distinguished himself as one of the most prolific and grounded historians of occult and esoteric movements. A rebel until the end, Wilson later in life wrote stirring intellectual defenses of optimism, challenging the dark vogue of figures such as Bertolt Brecht and Samuel Beckett. He died in Cornwall, England, in late 2013.1<br><br>The Country of the Blind<br><br>At first sight, the Outsider is a social problem. He is the hole-in-corner man.<br><br>In the air, on top of a tram, a girl is sitting. Her dress, lifted a little, blows out. But a block in the traffic separates us. The tramcar glides away, fading like a nightmare.<br><br>Moving in both directions, the street is full of dresses which sway, offering themselves airily, the skirts lifting; dresses that lift and yet do not lift.<br><br>In the tall and narrow shop mirror I see myself approaching, rather pale and heavy-eyed. It is not a woman I want-it is all women, and I seek for them in those around me, one by one. . . .<br><br>This passage, from Henri Barbusse's novel L'Enfer, pinpoints certain aspects of the Outsider. His hero walks down a Paris street, and the desires that stir in him separate him sharply from other people. And the need he feels for a woman is not entirely animal either, for he goes on:<br><br>Defeated, I followed my impulse casually. I followed a woman who had been watching me from her corner. Then we walked side by side. We said a few words; she took me home with her. . . . Then I went through the banal scene. It passed like a sudden hurtling-down.<br><br>Again, I am on the pavement, and I am not at peace as I had hoped. An immense confusion bewilders me. It is as if I could not see things as they were. I see too deep and too much.<br><br>Throughout the book, this hero remains unnamed. He is the anonymous Man Outside.<br><br>He comes to Paris from the country; he finds a position in a bank; he takes a room in a "family hotel." Left alone in his room, he meditates: He has "no genius, no mission to fulfill, no remarkable feelings to bestow. I have nothing and I deserve nothing. Yet in spite of it, I desire some sort of recompense." Religion . . . he doesn't care for it. "As to philosophic discussions, they seem to me altogether meaningless. Nothing can be tested, nothing verified. Truth-what do they mean by it?" His thoughts range vaguely from a past love affair and its physical pleasures, to death: "Death, that is the most important of all ideas." Then back to his living problems: "I must make money." He notices a light high up on his wall; it is coming from the next room. He stands on the bed and looks through the spy-hole:<br><br>I look, I see. . . . The next room offers itself to me in its nakedness.<br><br>The action of the novel begins. Daily, he stands on the bed and stares at the life that comes and goes in the next room. For the space of a month he watches it, standing apart and, symbolically, above. His first vicarious adventure is to watch a woman who has taken the room for the night; he excites himself to hysteria watching her undress. These pages of the book have the kind of deliberate sensationalism that its descendants in post-war France were so consistently to be accused of (so that Guido Ruggiero could write: "Existentialism treats life in the manner of a thriller").<br><br>But the point is to come. The next day he tries to recreate the scene in imagination, but it evades him, just as his attempt to recreate the sexual pleasures with his mistress had evaded him:<br><br>I let myself be drawn into inventing details to recapture the intensity of the experience. "She put herself into the most inviting positions."<br><br>No, no, that is not true.<br><br>These words are all dead. They leave untouched, powerless to affect it, the intensity of what was.<br><br>At the end of L'Enfer, its nameless hero is introduced to a novelist who is entertaining the company with an account of a novel he is writing. A coincidence . . . it is about a man who pierces a hole in his wall and spies on all that happens in the next room. The writer recounts all of the book he has written; his listeners admire it: Bravo! Tremendous success! But the Outsider listens gloomily. "I, who had penetrated into the very heart of mankind and returned, could see nothing human in this pantomimic caricature. It was so superficial that it was false." The novelist expounds: "Man stripped of his externals . . . that is what I wish to show. Others stand for imagination . . . I stand for truth." The Outsider feels that what he has seen is truth.<br><br>Admittedly, for us, reading the novel half a century after it was written, there is not so much to choose between the novelist's truth and the hero's. The "dramas" enacted in the next room remind us sometimes of Sardou, sometimes of Dostoevsky when he is more concerned to expound an idea than to give it body in people and events. Yet Barbusse is sincere, and this ideal, to "stand for truth," is the one discernible current that flows through all twentieth-century literature.<br><br>Barbusse's Outsider has all of the characteristics of the type. Is he an Outsider because he's frustrated and neurotic? Or is he neurotic because of some deeper instinct that pushes him into solitude? He is preoccupied with sex, with crime, with disease. Early in the novel he recounts the after-dinner conversation of a barrister; he is speaking of the trial of a man who has raped and strangled a little girl. All other conversation stops, and the Outsider observes his neighbors closely as they listen to the revolting details:<br><br>A young mother, with her daughter at her side, has half got up to leave, but cannot drag herself away. . . .<br><br>And the men; one of them, simple, placid, I heard distinctly panting. Another, with the neutral appearance of a bourgeois, talks commonplaces with difficulty to his young neighbor. But he looks at her as if he would pierce deeply into her, and deeper yet. His piercing glance is stronger than himself, and he is ashamed of it. . . .<br><br>The Outsider's case against society is very clear. All men and women have these dangerous, unnamable impulses, yet they keep up a pretense, to themselves, to others; their respectability, their philosophy, their religion, are all attempts to gloss over, to make look civilized and rational something that is savage, unorganized, irrational. He is an Outsider because he stands for Truth.<br><br>That is his case. But it is weakened by his obvious abnormality, his introversion. It looks, in fact, like an attempt at self-justification by a man who knows himself to be degenerate, diseased, self-divided. There is certainly self-division. The man who watches a woman undressing has the red eyes of an ape; yet the man who sees two young lovers, really alone for the first time, who brings out all the pathos, the tenderness and uncertainty when he tells about it, is no brute; he is very much human. And the ape and the man exist in one body; and when the ape's desires are about to be fulfilled, he disappears and is succeeded by the man, who is disgusted with the ape's appetites.<br><br>This is the problem of the Outsider. We shall encounter it under many different forms in the course of this book: on a metaphysical level, with Sartre and Camus (where it is called Existentialism), on a religious level, with Boehme and Kierkegaard; even on a criminal level, with Dostoevsky's Stavrogin (who also raped a small girl and was responsible for her death). The problem remains essentially the same; it is merely a question of discounting more or less as irrelevant.<br><br>Barbusse has suggested that it is the fact that his hero sees deeper that makes him an Outsider; at the same time, he states that he has "no special genius, no message to bestow," etc., and from his history during the remainder of the book, we have no reason to doubt his word. Indubitably, the hero is mediocre; he can't write for toffee, and the whole book is full of clich�s. It is necessary to emphasize this in order to rid ourselves of the temptation to identify the Outsider with the artist, and so to oversimplify the question: disease or insight? Many great artists have none of the characteristics of the Outsider. Shakespeare, Dante, Keats were all apparently normal and socially well-adjusted, lacking anything that could be pitched on as disease or nervous disability. Keats, who always makes a very clear and romantic distinction between the poet and the ordinary man, seems to have had no shades of inferiority complexes or sexual neuroses lurking in the background of his mind; no D. H. Lawrence-ish sense of social-level, no James Joycian need to assert his intellectual superiority; above all, no sympathy whatever with the attitude of Villiers De L'Isle Adam's Axel (so much admired by Yeats): "As for living, our servants can do that for us." If any man intended to do his own living for himself, it was Keats. And he is undoubtedly the rule rather than the exception among great poets. The Outsider may be an artist, but the artist is not necessarily an Outsider.<br><br>What can be said to characterize the Outsider is a sense of strangeness, of unreality. Even Keats could write, in a letter to Browne just before he died: "I feel as if I had died already and am now living a posthumous existence." This is the sense of unreality, that can strike out of a perfectly clear sky. Good health and strong nerves can make it unlikely; but that may be only because the man in good health is thinking about other things and doesn't look in the direction where the uncertainty lies. And once a man has seen it, the world can never afterward be quite the same straightforward place. Barbusse has shown us that the Outsider is a man who cannot live in the comfortable, insulated world of the bourgeois, accepting what he sees and touches as reality. "He sees too deep and too much," and what he sees is essentially chaos. For the bourgeois, the world is fundamentally an orderly place, with a disturbing element of the irrational, the terrifying, which his preoccupation with the present usually permits him to ignore. For the Outsider, the world is not rational, not orderly. When he asserts his sense of anarchy in the face of the bourgeois' complacent acceptance, it is not simply the need to cock a snook at respectability that provokes him; it is a distressing sense that truth must be told at all costs, otherwise there can be no hope for an ultimate restoration of order. Even if there seems no room for hope, truth must be told. (The example we are turning to now is a curious instance of this.) The Outsider is a man who has awakened to chaos. He may have no reason to believe that chaos is positive, the germ of life (in the Kabbala, chaos-tohu bohu-is simply a state in which order is latent; the egg is the "chaos" of the bird); in spite of this, truth must be told, chaos must be faced.<br><br>The last published work of H. G. Wells gives us an insight into such an awakening. Mind at the End of Its Tether seems to have been written to record some revelation:<br><br>The writer finds very considerable reason for believing that within a period to be estimated by weeks and months rather than by aeons, there has been a fundamental change in the conditions under which life-and not simply human life but all self-conscious existence-has been going on since its beginning. If his thinking has been sound . . . the end of everything we call life is close at hand and cannot be evaded. He is telling you the conclusions to which reality has driven his own mind, and he thinks you may be interested enough to consider them, but he is not attempting to impose them on you.<br><br>This last sentence is noteworthy for its curious logic. Wells's conviction that life is at an end is, as he says, a "stupendous proposition." If it is true, then it negates the whole pamphlet; obviously, since it negates all life and its phenomena. Vaguely aware of the contradiction, Wells explains that he is writing "under the urgency of a scientific training that obliged him to clarify the world and his ideas to the limits of his capacity."<br><br>His renascent intelligence finds itself confronted with strange, convincing realities so overwhelming that, were he indeed one of those logical, consistent people we incline to claim we are, he would think day and night in a passion of concentration, dismay and mental struggle upon the ultimate disaster that confronts our species. We are nothing of the sort. We live with reference to past experience, not to future events, however inevitable.<br><br>In commenting on an earlier book called The Conquest of Time, Wells comments: "Such conquest as that book admits is done by time rather than man."<br><br>Time like an ever rolling stream bears all its sons away<br><br>They fly forgotten as a dream dies at the opening day.<br><br>This is the authentic Shakespearian pessimism, straight out of Macbeth or Timon. It is a surprising note from the man who had spent his life preaching the credo: If you don't like your life you can change it: the optimist of Men Like Gods and A Modern Utopia. Wells declares that, if the reader will follow him closely, he will give the reason for this change of outlook:<br><br>The reality glares coldly and harshly upon any of those who can wrench their minds free . . . to face the unsparing question that has overwhelmed the writer. They discover that a frightful queerness has come into life. . . . The habitual interest of the writer is his critical anticipation. Of everything he asks: To what will this lead? And it was natural for him to assume that there was a limit set to change, that new things and events would appear, but that they would appear consistently, preserving the natural sequence of life. So that in the present vast confusion of our world, there was always the assumption of an ultimate restoration of rationality. . . . It was merely the fascinating question of what forms the new rational phase would assume, what over-man, Erewhon or what not would break through the transitory clouds and turmoil. To this the writer set his mind.<br><br>He did his utmost to pursue that upward spiral . . . toward their convergence in a new phase in the story of life, and the more he weighed the realities before him, the less he was able to detect any convergence whatever. Changes had ceased to be systematic, and the further he estimated the course they seemed to be taking, the greater the divergence. Hitherto, events had been held together by a certain logical consistency, as the heavenly bodies have been held together by gravitation. Now it is as if that cord had vanished, and everything was driving anyhow to anywhere at a steadily increasing velocity. . . .

Over years of groundbreaking experiments, he has distilled remarkable discoveries significant enough to become the bedrock of a whole new scientific field: social physics. Humans have more in common with bees than we like to admit: We&#x2019;re social creatures first and foremost. Our most important habits of action&#x2014;and most basic notions of common sense&#x2014;are wired into us through our coordination in social groups. Social physics is about <i>idea flow</i>, the way human social networks spread ideas and transform those ideas into behaviors.<br><br> Thanks to the millions of digital bread crumbs people leave behind via smartphones, GPS devices, and the Internet, the amount of new information we have about human activity is truly profound. Until now, sociologists have depended on limited data sets and surveys that tell us how people <i>say</i> they think and behave, rather than what they actually <i>do</i>. As a result, we&#x2019;ve been stuck with the same stale social structures&#x2014;classes, markets&#x2014;and a focus on individual actors, data snapshots, and steady states. Pentland shows that, in fact, humans respond much more powerfully to social incentives that involve rewarding others and strengthening the ties that bind than incentives that involve only their own economic self-interest.<br><br> Pentland and his teams have found that they can study <i>patterns </i>of information exchange in a social network without any knowledge of the actual <i>content </i>of the information and predict with stunning accuracy how productive and effective that network is, whether it&#x2019;s a business or an entire city. We can maximize a group&#x2019;s collective intelligence to improve performance and use social incentives to create new organizations and guide them through disruptive change in a way that maximizes the good. At every level of interaction, from small groups to large cities, social networks can be tuned to increase exploration and engagement, thus vastly improving idea flow.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Social Physics</i> will change the way we think about how we learn and how our social groups work&#x2014;and can be made to work better, at every level of society. Pentland leads readers to the edge of the most important revolution in the study of social behavior in a generation, an entirely new way to look at life itself.</p><p><b>Alex "Sandy" Pentland </b>directs MIT&#x2019;s Human Dynamics Laboratory and the MIT Media Lab Entrepreneurship Program and co-leads the World Economic Forum Big Data and Personal Data initiatives.

His wise and stimulating book teaches us how ideas spring up, flow, and spread. Applying his lessons, we can act collectively to solve previously intractable social, economic and political problems. We can make organizations more productive. We can even have government achieve its proper purposes, with greater fairness and less cost. As challenges like widening inequality and runaway climate change seem to exceed our ability to design solutions, Pentland&#x2019;s data-driven, reality-based, yet sunny optimism about tomorrow should be eagerly welcomed by all readers.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Stephen M.

Through the concepts and examples offered, the improvisor should be able to use this material alongside already familiar tonal ideas. Specifically, the book serves as a guide for organizing chromaticism into a coherent musical statement meant to satisfy both the intellectual and emotional needs of artistic creation. The reader will be introduced to more than one way of conceiving chromatic lines and harmonies. There is nothing theoretically complex or new in the text---it is the organization of the material as well as many musical examples and transcriptions (Bach, Scriabin, Coltrane, Shorter, Hancock, Beirach, Liebman) which should serve to inspire musicians to expand their usual diatonic vocabulary. This book also provides insight into the style of playing that David Liebman is known for. In addition, the book contains 100 assorted solo lines and 100 chord voicings.</p><p></p><h2>Mere Motherhood Newsletters</h2><p>I am Cindy Rollins author of Mere Motherhood, A Handbook to Morning Time, and Hallelujah A Journey Through Advent with Handel's Messiah.

'Arabi, whose metaphysical teachings have had a profound influence on both the Muslim and Christian worlds, is known as one of the greatest writers of mystical love poetry of all time. <br> <br>Written in answer to the questions of a friend, this illuminating guide describes the evolutionary path of our higher spiritual aspirations--the quest for the ultimate reality, the journey toward God. It is chiefly concerned with spiritual retreat, an advanced and potentially dangerous Sufi practice that aims at the attainment of the Presence of God through absolute abandonment of the world. Realizing the imagination's deceptive power, 'Arabi warns that this form of retreat should not be undertaken except at the order of a sheikh or by one who has mastered the self. Each stage of the journey is accompanied by a temptation which can be overcome only by an unshakable desire for God. <br> <br>'Arabi explains each step of the ascent leading toward human perfection. In this perilous voyage of self-discovery, the reader will encounter the Realms of the mineral, vegetable, and animal worlds, eventually reaching the Gardens and the Throne of Mercy. The traveler of the Sufi mystic path is called upon to cleanse his or her heart in order to safely reach the final destination--the Lord of Power.</p><p>Text: English, Turkish (translation)</p><h2>Weird Arizona: Your Travel Guide to Arizona&#39;s Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets (Volume 3)</h2><p><p>Most of Arizona remains unspoiled, uninhabited America.

It relates the story of farmers and their obligations to their families, to the animals they fed, and to the land they tended. But The Haymakersis also an elegy&#x2014;to a way of life fast disappearing from our landscape. In the most heartfelt essays, Hoffbeck chronicles his own family's struggle to hold onto their family farm and his personal struggle in deciding to leave farming for another way of life.<br><br>Hoffbeck also seeks to document and preserve the commonplace methods of haymaking, information about haying that might otherwise be lost to posterity. He describes the tools and the methods of haymaking as well as the relentless demands of the farm. Using diaries, agricultural guidebooks and personal interviews, the folkways of cutting, raking, and harvesting hay have been recorded in these chapters. In the end, this book is not so much about agricultural history as it is about family history, personal history&#x2014;how farm families survive, even persevere.</p><p>"My heart ached when I finished this book. Let&#x2019;s say it&#x2019;s about more than haying, more than farm equipment, more than the survival of five farm families. It is all of these, but what makes The Haymakers extraordinary is Hoffbeck&#x2019;s compassion for the people he writes about combined with his storyteller&#x2019;s ability to make the stuff of history come alive on the page." &#x2014; Jim Heynen, author of The One-Room Schoolhouse <p>"Hoffbeck&#x2019;s hay, like Whitman&#x2019;s grass, surprises the reader by turning out to be a large metaphor for our history and its effect on American interior life. While hay itself remains a wonder&#x2014;a miracle even&#x2014;the machinery we use to harvest and profit from it grows into a monster that harvests us, both economically and literally. From the elegant introductory essay on the nature and lore of hay to the sad family history of the afterword, Hoffbeck has made a sound and intelligent read for his audience&#x2014;which should include all of us." &#x2014; Bill Holm, author of The Heart Can Be Filled Up Anywhere on Earth and The Music of Failure </p><p>"Steven Hoffbeck&#x2019;s The Haymakers is a love story and a requiem. Imaginatively weaving material gleaned from interviews, diaries, and the agricultural press, he lovingly recreates the hard work and the tragedies of Minnesota farm families from the time of the Civil War to the present. During those years the technology of haying has changed dramatically. Hoffbeck brings the reader into the hayfields and haylofts to experience these changes. He succeeds in causing the reader &#x2018;to feel the burning July sun and the noonday heat that made haying one of the hardest tasks of agriculture.&#x2019; More than that, the author tells the stories of the lives of five farmers, mostly immigrants or the sons of immigrants, their families, and the rural communities to which they belonged." &#x2014; Allen R. Yale, Jr., author of While the Sun Shines: Making Hay in Vermont, 1789&#x2013;1990</p>&#34;This is a book of remembrance, a book tracing the role of haymaking in the lives of five farm families [from the mid-nineteenth century] through the present. . . . This is not meant to be a detailed technical manual on haymaking. . . . Instead I have tried to tell the stories of families on farms and how haying was part of the seasonal rhythms of their everyday lives, the larger rhythms of life and death. Those of us who grew up on farms have only to count the number of farm deaths in our own communities to understand that every family will eventually suffer its own set of tragedies. . . . Wound around my memories of summers haying with my dad and brothers are deeper threads of mourning. Danger, both natural and mechanical, is woven into the fabric of farmwork. This book is a tribute not only to those who lost their lives on farms but, also, to those who hav endured despite those losses and continued to work their farmsteads.&#34;--From the Prologue</p><h2>Boricuas: Influential Puerto Rican Writings--An Anthology</h2><p>MANY CULTURES * ONE WORLD<br>"Boricua is what Puerto Ricans call one another as a term of endearment, respect, and cultural affirmation; it is a timeless declaration that transcends gender and color.

Challenging the idea that today's preachers must do away with biblical or expository preaching if they are to reach non-Christian people, Eswine offers a way of preaching that embraces biblical exposition in missional terms. Recognizing all of the different cultural situations in which the gospel must be preached, he gives preachers practical advice on preaching in a global context while remaining faithful to the Bible.<br>Pastors, seminarians, and church and ministry leaders who speak in various contexts will welcome this fresh, thoughtful examination of bringing the Word to today's multi-everything, post-everything world.</p><p>The sermon is dead. Long live the sermon.<br><br>Do you think a postmodern audience may render your preaching post-relevant? Think again. Zack Eswine takes you through the nuts and bolts--and the heart and soul--of engaging today's multicultural society with compelling messages from the pulpit. Such preaching, however, requires more than just contextualizing the message.<br><br>Using this comprehensive and practical guide will help you to preach God's truth without compromising doctrine or ignoring the faithful. Eswine shows how God's own interactions with humanity model relevant preaching and offers fresh, field-tested insights into the application of homiletics. Valuable appendixes detail steps to an effective sermon and provide questions for assessing cultural developments with spiritual discernment.<br><br>Whether a new or experienced speaker, in church leadership or in parachurch ministry, you can make an impact on the rising global village--starting now.<br><br>"Zack Eswine moves the Christ-centered preaching movement forward with this volume. He not only calls us to carefully contextualize our message to various cultures, sensibilities, and habits of heart, but he also gives us a host of practical tools, inventories, and guidelines for doing so. All the while he assumes and strengthens the foundational commitment to preaching Christ and his restoring grace from every text. A great contribution."--Tim Keller, senior pastor, Redeemer Presbyterian Church, New York City<br><br>"As a pastor/homiletician, Zack Eswine stands between the two worlds of the academy and the church, inviting biblical preachers to journey to the missional intersection where priest, prophet, and sage converge and converse. Navigating them through the turbulent waters of a post-everything culture, they arrive at the shore of homiletical hybridity: the terra firma of biblical revelation and contemporary relevance. Get on board!"--Robert Smith Jr., associate professor of divinity, Beeson Divinity School, Samford University<b>Zack Eswine</b> (PhD, Regent University) is assistant professor of homiletics and associate dean of ministry formation at Covenant Theological Seminary.

Well-known fiber artist Wen Redmond starts with the tools and equipment you'll need&#x2015;any image editing software and a standard inkjet printer&#x2015;and teaches you to alter images, print them on a variety of fibers, and accentuate them with stitching. With a sense of adventure, even a beginner can apply these mixed-media techniques to create new and innovative works of art.</p><p>Wen Redmond is a mixed-media artist whose work embraces digital printing, surface design, fiber art, and collage. She has created several signature digital fiber techniques, including holographic images, innovative collage methods, and textured photographs. She lives in New England.Digital fibre art is one of Wen's signature techniques. She has been recognised in the textile/fibre world for decades, and this experience and expertise is well reflected here. As with most how-to books, it starts at the beginning with the kinds of tools and equipment needed to give a good result. Wen then takes off from there, showing how to alter images, print them on different fabrics, and then apply stitch for added depth, interest, and highlighting. By incorporating a number of different techniques, the finished work looks more layered and complex, but it is very achievable. An interested beginner should not be put off, as Wen offers many tips. At the same time, experience artists will find enough here to take their work to the next level. (<i>Down Under Textiles, Issue 25</i>)<br><br>Wen Redmond has been experimenting with different styles and techniques for many years, and this book distils her work with digital images and various materials. The book is only 127 pages, but is jam packed with information&#x2015;you will find much of what you need to know here. Wen covers topics including taking photos, manipulating them through cropping filters and colours, printing and transferring them, layering and blending. She also writes about fabric preparation, using paper and other substrates, and the various paint and other substrates, and the various paint and other layers than can be added. There are any examples shown, with full and detailed visuals and written explanations. This is a perfect book to have on the bookshelf to refer to when you are looking to create a particular effect. Alternatively, use it as a guided series of exercises to extend your repertoire of techniques. (<i>Down Under Textiles, #27</i>)<br><br>For those of you enjoying Wen Redmond's Holographic Pictures technique in this issue, you can find the application of digital photography to textiles and mixed media expanded upon in this book. It looks at many different ways of using photography with different substrates and mediums to create a wholly unique approach to your art. It is a very user-friendly book with a lot of tips on how to make your own life easier (you can use photos taken on your phone as the techniques here will make allowances for a lower resolution in the pictures) and there are apps suggested, such as Grungetastic, that will make the whole process of jazzing up your photo much easier if you aren't able to slave over Photoshop or another Photo Editing programme. The latter will provide you with more complex images to play with but this allows anyone with basic technology to have a go. The book is helpfully divided up into sections such as using fabric or paper as substrates, using Pre-Coats (such as InkAid) and basic Digital Photography printing before moving onto more experimental chapter, using acrylic mediums, overlays, creating textured surfaces for blending or printing over and using nonporous substrates. Each section is fully illustrated and clearly explained in stages and each chapter contains its own Process and Example sections so you can get to grips with how to achieve an effect and then see some finished pieces. (<i>Workshop on the Web, March 2017</i>)<br><br>Inkjet printers can be used to print on a variety of substrates, and mixed-media artist Redmond shares how best to combine printed fabric or paper with paint, photographs, and art supplies such as gel medium to create one-of-a-kind works of art. There's not much guidance or direction&#x2015;much of this book is Redmond providing a brief overview of her process. The information is delivered in a jumbled rather than a linear fashion, making the lack of an index to the contents disappointing. VERDICT: Beginners to the world of mixed media may be frustrated that basic knowledge is assumed, but experienced mixed-media artists seeking inspiration from a skilled artist may gain insight into new processes. (<i>Library Journal, 2/1/17</i>)<br><br>Wen Redmond has produced a visually inspiring book featuring her photographs, quilts, and processes. Wen explores a large variety of photo editing options, including many that can be done directly on your phone. She demonstrates how to prepare and treat fabric for printing to promote longevity, and how to manipulate each step of the process so that it is tailored to the artist's interest, skill, and creative desire. (<i>Quilting Arts, April/May 2017</i>)<br><br>This stimulating guide to combining digitally altered photos and surface materials to create mixed-media designs centres around artist Wen Redmond's passion for photographs and fabric.

(<i>ASG Notions, Fall 2017</i>)<br><br>What to do with my burgeoning stock of digital photographs has been a nagging source of torment: unworthy of print but too-good-to-ditch, my computer was beginning to protest as yet more fascinating gems were shoe-horned into the collection, And then Digital Fiber Art flopped through the letter box and my dilemma was over! Wen Redmond, a distinguished quilter and mixed media artiest, experiments with manipulating and printing digital images on a multitude of substrates including fabrics and paper. Peppered with images in various stages of completion, this feast of ideas will kick-start the imagination of any flagging fibre artist&#x2015;or hoarder of digital images and textiles!Wen's passion for her art shines through, as she takes the reader through the creative journey from capturing stimulating images and then manipulating them. She covers the type of printer to use and preparation of the substrate, followed by further processing techniques. These include overlaying with gauzes and scrims, underpainting and overpainting, medium lifts, and the addition of texture using recycled scraps. Showing complete familiarity with the tools, techniques and products she describes, Wen's inspirational combination of textiles and digital images will surely motivate the adventurous-spirited reader to compose, create and print innovative textile art too.

When the flotilla of writers and photographers arrived on the island a few days later only to find themselves itching, sweating, and swatting at pestiferous gnats and bloodthirsty mosquitoes, they wondered why such a worldly and sophisticated couple had chosen such a tick-infested spot. In&nbsp;<em>Cumberland Island</em>, Charles Seabrook uses his talent as an award-winning environmental writer to describe the island&#x2019;s natural bounty and to tell its long and intriguing history. You&#x2019;ll meet Catherine &#x201c;Caty&#x201d; Greene Miller, the widow of Revolutionary War hero Nathanael Greene and the woman who inspired Eli Whitney to invent the cotton gin. There&#x2019;s Miss Lucy Ferguson, considered by many to be the toughest and orneriest of all the strong women who inhabited the island, reigning over it during the 1960s and &#x2019;70s. The present-day generation is represented by Janet &#x201c;GoGo&#x201d; Ferguson, Miss Lucy&#x2019;s granddaughter, who made the arrangements for the Kennedy and Bessette wedding and crafted their wedding rings as well. Today, the island serves as a lightning rod for controversy. Although the island is currently under the purview of the National Park Service, some descendants still reside on the island. The dispute over the sale of land by cash-strapped landowners to commercial developers creates as much heated debate as the discussion of how the Park Service should balance the management of a wilderness area with the privileges accorded the residents. Included in these two debates are the questions of whether the island&#x2019;s signature wild-horse herd should be dispersed because of the environmental damage it wreaks and whether the historic mansions that still pepper the island be allowed to crumble to ruin for the sake of wilderness preservation.</p> <p>Charles Seabrook has been a long-time environmental writer for the&nbsp;<i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>. His popular weekly column called "Wild Georgia" was the victim of cutbacks. However, in 2008, the paper reinstituted the column due to reader demand. In 1981, Seabrook was one of the first reporters in the world to write about a mysterious and burgeoning disease that would soon be known as AIDS. In addition, he has written extensively on global warming, air and water pollution, and songbird decline. He has won awards from the National Wildlife Federation, the Southern Environmental Law Center, and various press organizations.

Her layover in Denver had already been far longer than planned because of a storm that was coming in from the West Coast, and now she was&#x2014;<em>-finally</em>&#x2014;waiting by a luggage carousel at the Cheyenne airport. And waiting... As her friend Karin always said, there were two kinds of luggage&#x2014;carry-on and lost. And hers appeared to be of the lost variety.<br><br>December 21 meant it was almost the festive season, but her spirits were definitely on the low side.<br><br>This airport mess was typical of the dismal way her luck had been running lately.<br><br><em>Let's see.</em> She'd had to arrange for her aunt Geneva to move into assisted living. Dealing with that, mostly by email and over the phone, hadn't been easy. Then there was the fact that a stranger was staying at Geneva's house, the house Charlotte had grown up in. Of course, she'd questioned her aunt about Mrs. Klozz, asking how she and the mysterious visitor had met, but Geneva's answers had been consistently vague, even evasive.<br><br>Worried, Charlotte had called Spencer Hogan, an old friend and Mustang Creek's chief of police, to request a background check. He'd chuckled and said that wouldn't be necessary; Mrs. Klozz was, as he'd put it, "all right."<br><br>Finally, Charlotte had decided to drop the subject. She'd meet the woman soon enough and form her own opinion.<br><br>Despite all this, she felt uneasy.<br><br>Then&#x2014;just when she'd thought things couldn't get any worse&#x2014;she'd been laid off. Merry, merry Christmas.<br><br>Oh, the company, an advertising firm, had given her a generous enough severance package. Her boss had explained that budget cuts were taking a toll on everyone.<br><br>Not on him, apparently. <em>His</em> job seemed to be safe, unlike her own. It had taken some effort to not say something to that effect, but in truth, she just wanted to go home.<br><br>As she watched everyone retrieving luggage while hers was, predictably, nowhere in sight, she realized how ironic it was&#x2014;as a teenager, she'd been convinced that all she wanted was to leave the small town of Mustang Creek, become successful, meet the right man and never look back. She'd done it. She'd left. She'd gotten a great job. She'd met the right man. But she sure had looked back.<br><br>There was one other hopeful passenger waiting, and they exchanged a shrug of commiseration. The carousel was still moving, so maybe...<br><br>Yep, she'd left the small town. Got the dream job&#x2014;and lost it. Met one Dr. Jaxon Locke, fell in love, and that hadn't worked, either.<br><br>The other passenger won the lottery and his case slid down.<br><br>"Happy holidays," he said in sympathy as he hurried away.<br><br>Then...a Christmas miracle! Her suitcase actually bumped out&#x2014;no more than two seconds before she was going to head over to the airline counter to fill in the claim form&#x2014;and began the journey toward her. Yay! Clean underwear for Christmas.<br><br>Aunt Geneva would tell her to count her blessings, and as she heaved her bag off the carousel and wheeled it toward the rental car area, Charlotte actually smiled. Things were already looking up. Oh, she still had to make the drive home with a giant storm roaring in, coasting a clipper from the Arctic, but at least she had her clothing. She'd need to make arrangements to have everything else sold or shipped home but would deal with that headache later. Her ridiculously expensive apartment had been sublet and all the rest of it was in storage.<br><br>The snow was coming in sideways when she finally reached her rental car. Nothing like driving an unfamiliar rig in bad weather, she thought, as she climbed into the midsize sedan and turned the key in the ignition.<br><br>She was on her way home.<br><br>After seven years in New York City.<br><br>Back in the day, she'd craved the city life, but now she simply wanted to get back to that big old drafty house, that <em>comfortable</em> house, where she'd grown up. Mustang Creek was the kind of small town where, if you sneezed, people were concerned you might be coming down with something and offered you their grandmother's favorite remedy. She wanted the fragrance of grass in the summer, the view of the Tetons, the old grape arbor in the backyard.<br><br>She wanted <em>home.</em><br><br>Geneva needed her, Charlotte mused as she tried to figure out how to turn on the windshield wipers. But <em>she</em> might need this change even more. Losing her job wasn't a financial catastrophe since her aunt had taught her a lot about saving her money. She hated that the vibrant woman she remembered was slowly fading. Still, Charlotte viewed her own changed circumstances as a positive in some ways. They'd be able to spend time together. Quality time. Not just the fly-in, fly-out visits of the past few years. She could take care of the house, maybe use some of her savings to fix it up. The place had needed a new roof for at least ten years. She'd offered to pay for it more than once, but Aunt Geneva, her only living relative, had declined.<br><br>Stubborn pride was a family trait, no question about that. She came by hers honestly.<br><br>She should've looked more closely at the forecast, she decided when whirls of snow, like errant ghosts, circled her car. Almost no one else was traveling, which was just as well, since she could barely see enough to stay in her own lane. Other than the dim lights of one car some distance behind her, she had the road to herself.<br><br>She was happy that she'd grabbed coffee and a sandwich in the Denver airport, although&#x2014;exhausted as she was&#x2014;she could've used another coffee right now. She slowed her speed even more as she squinted at the increasing whiteout conditions. There was one other immediate problem she hadn't considered. She didn't have keys to the house. Aunt Geneva had been a seamstress, working at home; she was a wizard with her machine and had probably made most of the wedding dresses in Bliss County for the past half century. So Charlotte had never really needed one.<br><br>To be honest, she wasn't even sure there <em>were</em> keys. The doors with their beautiful faceted glass panels were original, and to her knowledge the locks had never been replaced. Maybe Aunt Geneva had given keys to the friend who was watching her house and taking care of her beloved cat and dog, but it was already after ten, and she wasn't going to get to Mustang Creek anytime soon at this speed.<br><br>It seemed wrong to go pounding on the door at midnight when she didn't even know this Millicent Klozz. She certainly didn't want to wake the poor woman from a sound sleep.<br><br>"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" came on the radio, and Charlotte turned up the volume. She loved the song, which brought back memories of getting tucked into bed on Christmas Eve, Geneva reading her a story and forbidding her to go downstairs until daybreak.<br><br>She'd always heeded this admonition&#x2014;except for the year she was seven. She'd gone downstairs in the middle of the night&#x2014;not all the way down that creaky staircase because she'd known she'd get caught&#x2014;and seen the packages under the tree. When she'd heard Aunt Geneva get up&#x2014;for a drink of water, judging by the running tap&#x2014;Charlotte had taken a small liberty and peeked at the gifts. Most of them had <em>her</em> name on them.<br><br>Then she'd climbed into her aunt's bed and nestled there, eyes wide. When Geneva had rolled over, she'd given a small scream, obviously not expecting a small face right next to hers, dimly visible in the glow of the hallway night-light.<br><br>"Santa was here," Charlotte had informed her excitedly.<br><br>"I hope he brought me a new heart," Geneva had replied, after gasping and pressing her hand to her chest. "Lord, child, you startled me."<br><br>"He came to our house!"<br><br>Charlotte still remembered Geneva hugging her, remembered the warmth of her arms, the loving smile on her face. "Of course he did."<br><br>Negotiating a slick turn, Charlotte wondered what her aunt had sacrificed to make sure Santa came to their house every year. As a child she hadn't comprehended the effort that went into raising a toddler. Especially if you'd inherited that responsibility in your late fifties, because your much younger sister and her husband had died tragically in a train accident. Geneva had been single and inexperienced with tantrums and packing lunches, and later on, cheerleading practice and track meets, sleepovers with giggling girls.<br><br>Her aunt had done it all unf linchingly, and when it had come time for college, given her guidance, but let her choose. Now it was Charlotte's turn to give back.<br><br>Jaxon Locke had been chased all the way from Idaho by the storm and it was starting to catch up with him, mentally and physically.<br><br>He had no idea if he was being an idiot or not, going to Mustang Creek. After their breakup just over a year ago, he'd continued, though casually, to follow Charlotte Morgan on social media&#x2014;they'd "friended" each other. A few days before, he'd checked in on her page and discovered that she'd left the firm. Even if she hadn't mentioned her plans to return to Wyoming, he would have known where she was headed.<br><br>No part of him believed it was a coincidence that both he and Charlotte had ties to Mustang Creek. She'd been raised there, and he'd been hired by his friend Nate Cameron to work as a veterinarian in Nate's practice.<br><br>He'd met Charlotte&#x2014;Charlie, he called her&#x2014;through an online dating service. Sort of.<br><br>Except he'd cheated. Sort of. He'd sat next to the girlfriend of one of his college roommates at a cocktail party. The event had taken place in midtown Manhattan. He had been working in a nearby Connecticut town at the time, and he'd come into the city for his friend Remy's wedding. This woman had studied him over the rim of her cosmopolitan glass, then asked, "Single?"<br><br>No doubt she'd made that assumption because while he'd taken the time to pick out what he considered a nice shirt, he'd still worn jeans and boots. His best boots, expensive, but he'd probably looked like a cowboy. "Not married, not dating," he'd answered wryly. "The invitation said casual dress. I took it to heart."<br><br>Her lips had twitched. "You could use a haircut, too, but the look you've got going suits your style. Put you in an Armani suit, give you a five-o'clock shadow and you could be on the cover of a magazine. You're from where?"<br><br>"Originally, Idaho."<br><br>She'd gotten right to the point. "I know just the girl for you."<br><br>He'd doubted that, not only because she was dressed in three-inch heels, wore too much perfume and spent most of the time talking on her cell phone, but also because they were strangers. "You don't know anything about me."<br><br>"Sure I do. Remy's mentioned you before. You're an animal doctor, right? You and Remy and a bunch of other guys all met at Ohio State."<br><br>He'd nodded. "We shared a house. And, yes, I'm a veterinarian."<br><br>She'd leaned in a little closer. "I work with this girl who's beautiful, smart and hates the city as much as you obviously do but won't admit it. Loves animals and is from a small town. Here's the catch. She refuses blind dates from friends. I do know that she's recently joined an online dating service. Let me write down her name for you, plus the site info. It won't hurt to check out her profile."

And it wants more....</p><p><b>Faith Hunter</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Jane Yellowrock series, including <i>Shadow Rites</i>, <i>Dark Heir</i>, and <i>Broken Soul</i>; the Soulwood series, set in the world of Jane Yellowrock, including <i>Blood of the Earth</i>; and the Rogue Mage series, including <i>Host</i>, <i>Seraphs</i>, and <i>Bloodring</i>.One<br><br>I pulled up to Soulwood and let the truck lights shine on my house and garden. The trees were leafless, stark branches reaching up to the sky and down to the earth, roots thick and gnarled and digging deep. Leaves were piled against the foundation and against the garden fence. The three acres of grass needed to be cut, despite the time of year. Following on the heels of an early cold spell, the fall had been warmer than usual, and a second growth spurt had left the lawn unkempt and shaggy, the garden full of raggedy weeds and dead plants. I had never let my house and garden go untended for so long. It had been four weeks since I had been home, and then only for a long weekend. Now, the week before Thanksgiving, I was finally home from the training center for the Psychometry Law Enforcement Division of Homeland Security, known to its graduates-which I was one of, though I wouldn't go through formal graduation ceremonies until just before Christmas-as Spook School.<br><br>I opened the door of John's old Chevy C10 and the scent of home-rich loam, the creek out back, the tart scent of fall flowers, and the welcoming aroma of a wood fire from somewhere nearby-stopped me. I closed my eyes and simply breathed. The land around Richmond, Virginia, was practically lifeless, the air stank of exhaust, and the traffic roared from everywhere, the constant, distant drone of vehicles. Here, at the end of the dead-end road near the top of a low mountain, it was quiet and alive. The last of the leaves were falling, rustling across the ground, pushed by a steady, light breeze. The creak of the windmill that pumped my water sounded lonely but peaceful.<br><br>I left the truck door open and took two steps to the lawn, kicked off my shoes, and let my bare feet settle into the grass. Oh . . . home. Home, to Soulwood.<br><br>The earth reached up to me, knew me, and took me back into itself the way a mother hen gathers a chick beneath her wings. I stretched out on the lawn, face and body in contact with the ground, hands extended to my sides, and reached deep into the earth. I spread myself across the life there, rich and fecund and content. I didn't know what I was, not really, not yet, but I knew my land, and it knew me. I was home.<br><br>I sensed the new cell tower on the top of the hill between my property and the church. Sensed the turning of the windmill that pumped my water. The presence of the spring that fed the rivulet and the small pool out back. Sensed deer, squirrels, rabbits, and foxes, the fox family having broken up and separated into four overlapping but individual hunting territories.<br><br>This was my magic, simple and dark as it was: to read the land that I had claimed, and that had claimed me, to know what it needed. To heal it and be healed by it. And to feed the earth-though I seldom spoke of that part of my gift, that part that felt so good, yet was sinful by every human standard I knew.<br><br>But something in Soulwood was wrong, just as wrong as when I'd left to start Spook School. Then, there had been an evil something skittering around beneath the ground, a darkness that was my fault, and that I had no idea how to fix. I had hoped the problem would resolve itself, but it was still there, the soul of a cruel, violent man I had fed to the land, a soul that my woods hadn't absorbed, hadn't used, and I didn't know why.<br><br>The evil that had been Brother Ephraim was gathered tight on the edge of the woods, a hole in my awareness of the earth, deep and stark and quiet at the moment, somnolent. The foul soul now rested on the border where my property met the compound of God's Cloud of Glory Church, just over the crest of the mountain, the polygamous church I had grown up in.<br><br>The church, Brother Ephraim, and his cohorts had shaped, defined, and confined my life and my understanding of myself for every moment until Jane Yellowrock came into it. The rogue-vampire hunter had disrupted everything I was and everything I had by showing me that I could fight back. That I could take a stand.<br><br>It was ultimately because of her that I had fought back against the church. Ultimately because of her that I had fed the body and soul of Brother Ephraim to the land. Had taken a job as consultant with the Psychometry Law Enforcement Division of Homeland Security, working with Jane's ex-boyfriend, PsyLED special agent Rick LaFleur. And had later gone to Spook School so I might join PsyLED and fight evil paranormal things. The irony of me being an evil paranormal thing wasn't lost on me.<br><br>I still wasn't sure if I hated or loved Jane Yellowrock for all the changes in my life.<br><br>I was careful not to make Brother Ephraim aware of me. I had a feeling that his disembodied soul was just as dangerous dead as the churchman himself had been alive. Well, not man. Creature.<br><br>To get better contact with my woods, I placed my cheek on the night-cold grass, pressing my palms flat on the ground, reaching deep, communing with my land. I breathed out, searching lower into the earth, listening, feeling the magic that was Soulwood. The old magic of the woods was a strong and profound power, a deep well of energy, strength, and contentment. The power had weight and mass and a greatness that reminded me of God, but wasn't. And a magic that might become self-aware. Despite Ephraim's dark soul, this old power still held sway over Soulwood, and it seemed more alive, more interested, and, maybe, more conscious than before I left.<br><br>I lay in the grass, eyes closed, arms out, long enough for the mouser cats to find me, one settling onto my back, one curled around my head, the third walking up and down my legs, mewling. My mousers had missed me. I returned my thoughts to the boundary of the woods and to the blot of darkness. It was different from before. It had grown in size, had taken over a larger part of the land. I had to do something about it sooner or later. I knew the land could subsume it. I had seen it happen not that long ago in North Carolina, but I hadn't succeeded with Ephraim. Except for the blot, the land was happy and growing and satisfied. It was good to be back, peaceful, here on my land.<br><br>I tracked the energies of the earth out, and saw an odd glow to the east. Shimmering yellow with sparks of red and green and blue. I extended my senses, reaching out for it, but it faded like a candle on a foggy night.<br><br>Something trailed across my senses, like a cold, dead hand, smelling like a week-old corpse. Gripping the power of Soulwood, I whipped away from the foul sensation. Jerked myself clear. And saw the evil that was left of Brother Ephraim. It was awake, aware of me. The darkness gathered itself, shaping like an arrowhead, pointing at me. Using the land like a mental rope with knotted handholds, I began to withdraw, pulling myself back to the surface. Easing my way through stone and water and earth.<br><br>The malevolent arrowhead shot at me. Pierced me. Wrapped itself through me. Pulling me down. I yanked away, but the malicious soul twisted itself into me, stinking of death and maggots and the grave. Touching me where no one had ever touched me. Opening me. My deepest self. Violating me.<br><br>I couldn't draw a breath, couldn't move. My heart stuttered and missed a beat. Pain spiraled through me. My guts roiled as if the roots that had once grown inside me were twisting and stretching and growing, fast. Something electric sped through me-the awareness of death. I was dying. And I could almost hear the dark soul howling with satisfaction.<br><br>An electric spark, hot and flashing, hit me, flowed through me like electric lava. Ripped the evil thing off me, out of me. I wrenched free of the earth and to my feet. Cats tumbled off me, claws catching in my clothing, scraping my skin. Yowling.<br><br>I raced to the truck. Heart pounding, I climbed on the hood and sat, hugging my knees, trying to make sense of what had just happened. Shivering. Below the ground, I heard rumbling, as if boulders tumbled and broke in a flood, carried by massive waters. A vibration, like a small earthquake, shook and rocked the land, a battle of great forces.<br><br>It was Brother Ephraim and . . . and Soulwood.<br><br>Fighting.<br><br>Low in my belly, I could feel the clash of wills, a skirmish, a battle. Death and life in one place, occupying the same space, and not enough room there for both. Soulwood was trying to protect me, defend me. The wood had never done that before. I rubbed my palms up and down my icy arms, as if to remove the crawly feel of maggots on my flesh, a sensation that I usually associated with vampires or dead opossum. I sat, waiting. Breath fast, heart pounding.<br><br>Belowground, the battle ended as abruptly as it had begun. The darkness of Brother Ephraim yowled and raced away, back to his hole. Curled around himself in the small space he had carved out of the earth at the boundary of the church land. Beneath me, Soulwood settled.<br><br>Electric shocks still cascading through me, I bent my legs in a yoga posture, sitting on the warm truck hood like a child. I gulped and caught up on breathing and tried to figure out what had happened. Whatever it was, it was over.<br><br>But just in case, I stayed on the truck, trying to calm my mind and my body, both of which had gone into flight-or-fight mode-settling on flight, which seemed cowardly but had kept me alive, so I wasn't complaining. Unwilling to touch the earth with my feet, I sat there long enough for the truck's lights to dim. I was pretty sure it needed a new battery, or maybe a new alternator. It wasn't holding a charge. I had the money and the plans to take it into town this week and get it checked out.<br><br>But first I needed to find the courage to get off the truck, get unpacked, and let my family and PsyLED Unit Eighteen know I had made it home safely. The special agents were already established in the brand-new Knoxville PsyLED office, where I had a tiny cubicle waiting on me. But only if I got inside the house. Right. I could do this.<br><br>Dropping my arms, I let gravity take me, and I slid off the hood of the Chevy and inside the cab. Grabbed up my shoes and yanked them on, protecting myself from the land with a layer of leather. I cranked over the engine, to let it run a bit and charge up the battery. I was underdressed for the amount of time I had spent in contact with the land, and I was shivering. But at least the maggoty sensation was gone.<br><br>Feeling the long drive in my achy muscles, I left the truck running and made trips up the seven steps to the porch, stomping to build up body heat. I carried luggage filled with fall clothing that needed to be washed and mended and I dumped it all in no particular order at the front door, along with my umbrella and raincoat. My potted pansies and sage and chives I carried to the back porch, to be repotted. The soil in the pots had been dug out of Soulwood land, and the plants were in need of fresh soil, though that was as much for me to put my hands in when I was away from Soulwood as anything helpful for the plants. The soil and the contact it provided with my land had kept me sane while I was away for the weeks of training.<br><br>My weapons gear came next, from where I had stashed it behind the cab seat for transport. I had a newly issued service weapon, a Glock 20, locked in the plastic carrying case the weapon had come in, along with two magazines, each loaded with fifteen rounds, and a speed loader. It was a large case. There were also two boxes of ammunition, one standard, one silver-laced hollow points for vampires and were-creatures. My fitted body armor-a Kevlar and Dyneema composite, threaded throughout with a lining of thin silver foil to provide protection against weapons of all kinds, from gunfire to vampire claws to werewolf teeth-went on the porch floor beside the pile of other stuff. Gear, not stuff. Talking like a special agent was harder than I had expected. The silver-plated stakes-I couldn't afford solid sterling-and the ash wood stakes in their special sheaths went beside the weapon case, with the two vampire-killers, the fourteen-inch steel blades silver-plated. As a probationary special agent, I was already expected to fight my way out of any paranormal problems with guns and blades and magic. I had the training, the bruises, and the strained muscles to show for it.<br><br>I was no longer just a consultant; I had graduated under "special circumstances" at e3/GS 2 grade level. Technically, because I had passed background checks, stringent physicals, and weapons training as well as course work, I was a special agent, with an official title, a badge, and everything. However, because of my speciation classification and because I had no undergraduate degree and only a GED, I would be a probationary employee in PsyLED. If I survived the first full year of my employment in the paranormal branch of law enforcement, I'd move up to permanent employment, a higher pay grade, and access to greater levels of classified material.<br><br>To get here, most of my deepest, most private secrets had been released to the world of law enforcement I was now inhabiting. I didn't know if that was a good thing or a bad thing. Not yet.<br><br>Now lots of people knew that I wasn't human. I had magic. I was categorized as "nonhuman, paranormal, undifferentiated" by the government medical experts and biologists-undifferentiated because I didn't fit into the most common categories. I wasn't vampire, were-creature, witch, arcenciel, Welsh gwyllgi-pronounced something like gwee-shee-or even any of the other, lesser-known paranormal creatures that were being identified. So far as the biologists at Spook School knew, my sisters and I were a genetic family singularity, with Mud and me being the most alike and least human. I'd have kept us all a secret if I could have, but a paranormal-hating group called Human Speakers of Truth had outed us. I still hadn't told my family, proving me a bona fide coward. I was putting that off as long as possible.</p><h2>Broken Things</h2><p><p><strong>With all the intensity and whiplash turns of&nbsp;<em>Sharp Objects</em>&nbsp;and <em>One of Us Is Lying</em>, this engrossing psychological thriller by <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Lauren Oliver is an unforgettable, mesmerizing tale of exquisite obsession, spoiled innocence, and impossible friendships.</strong></p><p><strong><em>It&#x2019;s been five years since Summer Marks was brutally murdered in the woods. </em></strong></p><p>Everyone thinks Mia and Brynn killed their best friend.

We go to make explicit what we see Him doing implicitly. It is not a question of whether God is at work in His world . . . Our hope is to see more of God&#x2019;s people at work with Him! Learn about why we share our faith, Christ's role in our evangelism, the deep longings in all our hearts, and how to effectively live a sacramentally evangelistic lifestyle.</p><p>We are offering a way of looking at life and the world that is open to God&#x2019;s presence everywhere. This approach is called sacramental. And where better to experience God&#x2019;s presence than in His workplace? This is the Sacrament of Evangelism. </p></p><p><b>DR.

However, over time I realized that the deeper, unspoken fear was the assumption that evangelism is ultimately all about us and our skills. We suck up our courage and just hope that God will back us up! But we&#x2019;ve got it backwards. God always goes before us because He is already there.

His wide, hypnotic eyes peer at us from the cover of The Beatles&#x2019; <i>Sgt. Pepper&#x2019;s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>, and his influence can be found everywhere in popular culture.</p><p>Crowley, also known as the Great Beast, has been the subject of several biographies, some painting him as a misunderstood genius, others as a manipulative charlatan. None of them have looked seriously at his career as an agent of British Intelligence.</p><p>Using documents gleaned from British, American, French, and Italian archives, <i>Secret Agent 666</i> sensationally reveals that Crowley played a major role in the sinking of the Lusitania, a plot to overthrow the government of Spain, the thwarting of Irish and Indian nationalist conspiracies, and the 1941 flight of Rudolf Hess.</p><p>Author Richard B.

Children think in terms of big ideas.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In this unique book, the authors focus on big ideas&#x2014;like patterns, transformation, movement, balance, and relationships&#x2014;as a way to think about content, and they integrate science and mathematics through these big ideas, rather than linking them topically. The book looks at why it is important to think about thinking, introduces assessment early to help the teacher plan for assessment before teaching even begins, and sets up an environment that will support the construction of the big ideas that integrate math and science. Real-life scenarios provide invaluable insights into the teacher&#x2019;s thinking and planning, and each chapter includes two modules to be used for in-depth exploration of different aspects of the big ideas. It&#x2019;s a unique exploration of thinking and learning.</p></p><p><p> <b>Christine Chaille</b> is Professor and chair of the department of Curriculum and Instruction at Portland State University, focusing on early childhood education, where she has taught since 1991.

He&#x2019;s lost his girlfriend and still dreams of his time studying in America, but with a stable job, his own office and a half-empty apartment, he&#x2019;s settled in. When an American businessman turns up dead, his mentor Takamatsu calls him out to the site of a grisly murder. A glimpse from a security camera video suggests the killer was a woman, but in Japan, that seems unlikely. Hiroshi quickly learns how close homicide and suicide can appear in a city full of high-speed trains just a step&#x2014;or a push&#x2014;away. Takamatsu drags Hiroshi out to the hostess clubs and skyscraper offices of Tokyo in search of the killer. She&#x2019;s trying to escape Japan for a new life by playing a high-stakes game of insider information. To find her, Hiroshi goes deeper and deeper into Tokyo&#x2019;s intricate, ominous market for the most expensive real estate in the world. When Takamatsu inexplicably disappears, Hiroshi teams up with ex-sumo wrestler Sakaguchi. They scour Tokyo&#x2019;s sacred temples, corporate offices and industrial wastelands to find out where Takamatsu went, and why one woman would be driven to murder when she seems to have it all. In a megalopolis of 40 million people, finding one woman is nearly impossible. If he can&#x2019;t find her, more businessmen will die, she&#x2019;ll flee the country and the male-dominated, cutthroat world of buying and selling property will never change. After years in America and lost in neat, clean spreadsheets, Hiroshi confronts the stark realities of the biggest city in the world, where inside information can travel in a flash from the top investment firms to the bottom of the working world, where street-level punks and teenage hostesses sell their souls for a small cut of high-profit land deals. Hiroshi&#x2019;s determined to cut through Japan&#x2019;s ambiguities&#x2014;and dangers&#x2014;to find the murdering ex-hostess before she extracts her final revenge&#x2014;which just might be him.

Session beers, whose mild strength invites more than one round, adhere to high quality standards and are dedicated to balance and drinkability above all. Some naturally low-alcohol beer styles were &#x201c;sessionable&#x201d; long before that word was coined, but brewers have reinvented traditionally stronger classic beer styles to make them, too, well-suited to casual drinking sessions. Responsible consumption of these high-quality, easy-drinking beers gives beer lovers the freedom to celebrate community and friendship while consuming less alcohol. Such beers can be challenging to brew, but they present many opportunities to showcase skill, flavor, and refreshment. <em>Session Beers</em> explores the history behind some of the world's greatest session beers, past and present. Learn about the brewing processes and ingredients to master recipe development. Explore popular craft session beer recipes from some of the best brewmasters in America, and discover why beer drinkers enjoy exploring and drinking session beers.<br><br></p><p>"For me, the great collection of beer recipes in the second half, generously peppered with the personal stories of the brewers who make them, stands as the shining heart of this book.

It&#39;s a funk so fierce, the whole household feels topsy-turvy. Vanessa tries everything she can think of to cheer her up, but nothing seems to work. Then Virginia tells Vanessa about an imaginary, perfect place called Bloomsberry. Armed with an idea, Vanessa begins to paint Bloomsberry on the bedroom walls, transforming them into a beautiful garden complete with a ladder and swing ?so that what was down could climb up.? Before long, Virginia, too, has picked up a brush and undergoes a surprising transformation of her own.

The techniques presented here are streamlined through decades of experimentation, adjustments and simplification.

But for all the heat of claim and counter-claim, the argument is essentially beside the point: It&#x2019;s here; it&#x2019;s everywhere. The real question is, do we direct technology, or do we let ourselves be directed by it and those who have mastered it?

They remain in silent conflict until a final act brings rational closure to them both.</p><p>"It was terribly hot the summer Mr. Robertson left town." For Amy Goodrow and her mother, Isabelle, the heat of that summer is the least of their problems. Other citizens in the New England mill town of Shirley Falls are bothered by the heat and by "other things too: Further up the river crops weren't right--pole beans were small, shriveled on the vine, carrots stopped growing when they were no bigger than the fingers of a child; and two UFOs had apparently been sighted in the north of the state." But Amy and Isabelle have a more private misery: a seemingly unbridgeable chasm has opened between this once-close mother and daughter and nothing will ever be the same again. For Amy has fallen in love with her high-school math teacher, Mr. Robertson, who has gone way beyond the bounds of propriety by encouraging the crush. When Isabelle finds out, she is horrified to realize that her anger at him is dwarfed by her rage at her own daughter for "enjoying the sexual pleasures of a man while she herself had not." <p> Mother-daughter novels can, by virtue of their subject matter, often seem claustrophobic, a little overwrought; Elizabeth Strout masterfully avoids this problem by placing Amy and Isabelle in the larger context of the community they inhabit. Though her main focus is on the Goodrow women, Strout often detours into the lives and thoughts of her many secondary characters: Isabelle's coworkers Dottie Brown and Fat Bev; Amy's best friend, Stacy Burrows; Stacy's ex-boyfriend, Paul Bellows; and women from Isabelle's church such as Peg Dunlap and Barbara Rawley. She also introduces a chilling frisson of menace with the unsolved abduction of a 12-year-old girl and a mysterious obscene phone-caller. Like the best of Alice Hoffman, <i>Amy and Isabelle</i> offers up a moving yet resolutely unsentimental portrait of people coming to terms with their lives, finding unsuspected nobility in themselves and unexpected kindness in others along the way. Elizabeth Strout has written a gem of a novel. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>National Bestseller <br>In her stunning first novel, Amy and Isabelle, Elizabeth Strout evokes a teenager's alienation from her distant mother--and a parent's rage at the discovery of her daughter's sexual secrets. In most ways, Isabelle and Amy are like any mother and her 16-year-old daughter, a fierce mix of love and loathing exchanged in their every glance. And eating, sleeping, and working side by side in the gossip-ridden mill town of Shirley Falls doesn't help matters. But when Amy is discovered behind the steamed-up windows of a car with her math teacher, the vast and icy distance between mother and daughter becomes unbridgeable. <br>As news of the scandal reaches every ear, it is Isabelle who suffers from the harsh judgment of Shirley Falls, intensifying her shame about her own secret past. And as Amy seeks comfort elsewhere, she discovers the fragility of human happiness through other dramas, from the horror of a missing child to the trials of Fat Bev, the community peacemaker. Witty and often profound, Amy and Isabelle confirms Elizabeth Strout as a powerful new talent. <p><br></p></p><h2>The Roads to Modernity: The British, French, and American Enlightenments</h2><p><p>In an elegant, eminently readable work, one of our most distinguished intellectual historians gives us a brilliant revisionist history. <b>The Roads to Modernity</b> reclaims the Enlightenment&#x2013;an extraordinary time bursting with new ideas about human nature, politics, society, and religion--from historians who have downgraded its importance and from scholars who have given preeminence to the Enlightenment in France over concurrent movements in England and America.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Contrasting the Enlightenments in the three nations, Himmelfarb demonstrates the primacy and wisdom of the British, exemplified in such thinkers as Adam Smith, David Hume, and Edmund Burke, as well as the unique and enduring contributions of the American Founders. It is their Enlightenments, she argues, that created a social ethic&#x2013;humane, compassionate, and realistic&#x2013;that still resonates strongly today, in America perhaps even more than in Europe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>The Roads to Modernity</b> is a remarkable and illuminating contribution to the history of ideas.</p></p><p>Gertrude Himmelfarb taught for twenty-three years at Brooklyn College and the Graduate School of the City University of New York, where she was named Distinguished Professor of History in 1978.

Her previous books include:&nbsp;<i>The De-Moralization of Society: From Victorian Virtues to Modern Values; On Looking into the Abyss: Untimely Thoughts on Culture and Society; Poverty and Compassion: The Moral Imagination of the Late Victorians; The New History and the Old; Marriage and Morals Among the Victorians; The Idea of Poverty: England in the Early Industrial Age; On Liberty and Liberalism: The Case of John Stuart Mill; Victorian Minds </i>(nominated for a National Book Award)<i>; Darwin and the Darwinian Revolution; and Lord Acton: A Study in Conscience and Politics.</i><b>1. "Social Affections" and Religious Dispositions</b><br><br>The British did not have "philosophes." They had "moral philosophers," a very different breed. Those historians who belittle or dismiss the idea of a British Enlightenment do so because they do not recognize the features of the philosophes in the moral philosophers--and with good reason: the physiognomy is quite different.<br><br>It is ironic that the French should have paid tribute to John Locke and Isaac Newton as the guiding spirits of their own Enlightenment, while the British, although respectful of both, had a more ambiguous relationship with them. Newton was eulogized by David Hume as "the greatest and rarest genius that ever rose for the ornament and instruction of the species,"[1] and by Alexander Pope in the much quoted epitaph: "Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night;/God said, Let Newton be! and all was light." But Pope's An Essay on Man sent quite a different message: "The proper study of mankind is man" implied that materialism and science could penetrate into the mysteries of nature but not of man. In an earlier essay, the allusion to Newton was more obvious; it was human nature, not astronomy, Pope said, that was "the most useful object of humane reason," and it was "of more consequence to adjust the true nature and measures of right and wrong, than to settle the distance of the planets and compute the times of their circumvolutions."[2] While Newton received the adulation of his countrymen (he was master of the Royal Mint and president of the Royal Society, was knighted, and given a state funeral), and his scientific methodology was much praised, he had little substantive influence on the moral philosophers or on the issues that dominated the British Enlightenment. (His Opticks, on the other hand, was an inspiration for poets, who were entranced by the images and metaphors of light.)[3]<br><br>John Locke, too, was a formidable presence in eighteenth-century Britain, a best-selling author and a revered figure. But among the moral philosophers he was admired more for his politics than for his metaphysics. Indeed, the basic tenets of their philosophy implied a repudiation of his. What made them "moral philosophers" rather than "philosophers" tout court was their belief in a "moral sense" that was presumed to be if not innate in the human mind (as Francis Hutcheson thought), then so entrenched in the human sensibility, in the form of sympathy or "fellow-feeling" (as Adam Smith and David Hume had it), as to have the same compelling force as innate ideas.<br><br>Locke himself could not have been more explicit in rejecting innate ideas, whether moral or metaphysical. The mind, as he understood it, so far from being inhabited by innate ideas, was a tabula rasa, to be filled by sensations and experiences, and by the reflections rising from those sensations and experiences. The title of the first chapter of his Essay Concerning Human Understanding was "No Innate Speculative Principles" (that is, epistemological principles); the second, "No Innate Practical Principles" (moral principles). Even the golden rule, that "most unshaken rule of morality and foundation of all social virtue," would have been meaningless to one who had never heard that maxim and who might well ask for a reason justifying it, which "plainly shows it not to be innate." If virtue was generally approved, it was not because it was innate, but because it was "profitable," conducive to one's self-interest and happiness, the promotion of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Thus, things could be judged good or evil only by reference to pleasure or pain, which were themselves the product of sensation.[4]<br><br>Locke's Essay was published in 1690. Nine years later, the Earl of Shaftesbury wrote an essay that was, in effect, a refutation of Locke. This, too, had its ironies, for this Shaftesbury, the third earl, was brought up in the household of his grandfather, the first earl, who was a devotee of Locke and had employed him to supervise the education of his grandchildren. It was this experience that had inspired Locke's Thoughts Concerning Education--and inspired as well, perhaps, the pupil's rejection of his master's teachings.[5] Shaftesbury's essay, "An Inquiry Concerning Virtue, or Merit," was published (without his permission but to great acclaim) in 1699 and reprinted in 1711 in somewhat revised form in his Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times. That three-volume work, reissued posthumously three years later and in ten more editions in the course of the century, rivalled Locke's Second Treatise (a political, not metaphysical tract) as the most frequently reprinted work of the time. The hundred-page essay on virtue was the centerpiece of those volumes.<br><br>Virtue, according to Shaftesbury, derived not from religion, self-interest, sensation, or reason. All of these were instrumental in supporting or hindering virtue, but were not the immediate or primary source of it. What was "antecedent" to these was the "moral sense," the "sense of right and wrong."[6] [Shaftesbury's "moral sense" was very different from John Rawls's recent use of that term. For Shaftesbury it was an innate sense of right and wrong; for Rawls it is an intuitive conviction of the rightness of freedom and equality.] It was this sense that was "predominant...inwardly joined to us, and implanted in our nature," "a first principle in our constitution and make," as natural as "natural affection itself."[7] This "natural affection," moreover, was "social affection," an affection for "society and the public," which, so far from being at odds with one's private interest, or "self-affection," actually contributed to one's personal pleasure and happiness.[8] A person whose actions were motivated entirely or even largely by self-affection--by self-love, self-interest, or self-good--was not virtuous. Indeed, he was "in himself still vicious," for the virtuous man was motivated by nothing other than "a natural affection for his kind."[9]<br><br>This was not a Rousseauean idealization of human nature, of man before being corrupted by society. Nor was it a Pollyannaish expectation that all or even most men would behave virtuously all or most of the time. The moral sense attested to the sense of right and wrong in all men, the knowledge of right and wrong even when they chose to do wrong. Indeed, a good part of Shaftesbury's essay dealt with the variety of "hateful passions"--envy, malice, cruelty, lust--that beset mankind. Even virtue, Shaftesbury warned, could become vice when it was pursued to excess; an immoderate degree of "tenderness," for example, destroyed the "effect of love," and excessive "pity" rendered a man "incapable of giving succour."[10] The conclusion of the essay was a stirring testament of an ethic that, by its very nature--the "common nature" of man--was a social ethic: "Thus the wisdom of what rules, and is first and chief in nature, has made it to be according to the private interest and good of everyone to work towards the general good; which if a creature ceases to promote, he is actually so far wanting to himself and ceases to promote his own happiness and welfare.... And, thus, Virtue is the good, and Vice the ill of everyone."[11]<br><br>The contrast, not only with Thomas Hobbes but with Locke as well, could not be more obvious.[12] Neither was explicitly named by Shaftesbury, perhaps out of respect for Locke, who was still alive when the essay was written (although he had died by the time it was reissued). But no knowledgeable reader could have mistaken Shaftesbury's intention. In 1709 he wrote to one of his young proteges that Locke, even more than Hobbes, was the villain of the piece, for Hobbes's character and base slavish principles of government "took off the poison of his philosophy," whereas Locke's character and commendable principles of government made his philosophy even more reprehensible.<br><br> 'Twas Mr. Locke that struck at all fundamentals, threw all order and virtue out of the world.... Virtue, according to Mr. Locke, has no other measure, law, or rule, than fashion and custom: morality, justice, equity, depend only on law and will.... And thus neither right nor wrong, virtue nor vice are any thing in themselves; nor is there any trace or idea of them naturally imprinted on human minds. Experience and our catechism teach us all![13]<br><br> As Shaftesbury did not mention Locke in the Inquiry, so Bernard Mandeville did not mention Shaftesbury in The Fable of the Bees--at least not in the first edition, published in 1714. But appearing just then, a year after Shaftesbury's death and at the same time as the second edition of the Characteristics, Mandeville's readers might well take it as a rebuttal to Shaftesbury's work. The subtitle, Private Vices, Public Benefits, reads like a manifesto contra Shaftesbury.[14]<br><br>The original version of the Fable, published in 1705 as a sixpenny pamphlet (and pirated, Mandeville complained, in a halfpenny sheet), consisted of some thirty verses depicting a society, a hive of bees, where everyone was a knave, and where knavery served a valuable purpose. Every vice had its concomitant virtue: avarice contributed to prodigality, luxury to industry, folly to ingenuity. The result was a "grumbling" but productive hive, where "...every part was full of Vice,/ Yet the whole mass a Paradise." A well-intentioned attempt to rid the hive of vice had the effect of ridding it of its virtues as well, resulting in the destruction of the hive itself, as all the bees, "blest with content and honesty," abandoned industry and took refuge in a hollow tree.[15]<br><br>Lest the moral escape his readers, Mandeville reissued the poem in 1714 with a prefatory essay, "The Origin of Moral Virtue," and a score of lengthy "Remarks" amplifying lines of the poem; the editions of 1723 and 1724 added still other essays and remarks. In the enlarged version (now a full-length book), Mandeville elaborated upon his thesis. Self-love, which was reducible to pain and pleasure, was the primary motivation of all men, and what was generally called "pity" or "compassion"--the "fellow-feeling and condolence for the misfortunes and calamities of others"--was an entirely spurious passion, which unfortunately afflicted the weakest minds the most.[16] Moralists and philosophers, he conceded, generally took the opposite view, agreeing with the "noble writer" Lord Shaftesbury that "as man is made for society, so he ought to be born with a kind affection to the whole of which he is a part, and a propensity to seek the welfare of it."[17]<br><br>Maudeville's conclusion was sharp and uncompromising:<br><br>After this I flatter my self to have demonstrated that neither the friendly qualities and kind affections that are natural to man, nor the real virtues he is capable of acquiring by reason and self-denial are the foundation of society; but that what we call evil in this world, moral as well as natural, is the grand principle that makes us sociable creatures, the solid basis, the life and support of all trades and employments without exception; that there we must look for the true origin of all arts and sciences, and that the moment evil ceases, the society must be spoiled if not totally dissolved.[18]<br><br>The Fable of the Bees profoundly shocked contemporaries, provoking a frenzy of attacks culminating in a ruling handed down by the grand jury of Middlesex condemning it as a "public nuisance." Joining in the near-universal condemnation were most of the eighteenth-century greats--Bishop Berkeley, Francis Hutcheson, Edward Gibbon, Adam Smith. Smith expressed the general sentiment in pronouncing Mandeville's theory "licentious" and "wholly pernicious."[19] [Smith was offended not only by Mandeville's amoralism, his refusal to distinguish between vice and virtue, but also by his mercantilist views, which were a by-product of that philosophy. Because there was no natural moral sense and thus no natural harmony among men, Mandeville assumed that the government had to intervene to convert "private vices" into "public benefits." Mandeville is sometimes taken to be an apologist for capitalism; but it was mercantilism that was the logical deduction from his philosophy.]<br>Mandeville's was a spirited but futile attempt to abort the social ethic that was the distinctive feature of the British Enlightenment. That ethic derived neither from self-interest nor from reason (although both were congruent with it) but from a "moral sense" that inspired sympathy, benevolence, and compassion for others. Thus, where Locke, denying any innate principles, looked to education to inculcate in children the sentiment of "humanity," "benignity," or "compassion,"[20] Shaftesbury rooted that sentiment in nature and instinct rather than education or reason. "To compassionate," he wrote, "i.e., to join with in passion.... To commiserate, i.e., to join with in misery.... This in one order of life is right and good; nothing more harmonious; and to be without this, or not to feel this, is unnatural, horrid, immane [monstrous]."[21]<br><br>Two years after the publication of the expanded version of the Fable, Francis Hutcheson entered the debate with An Inquiry Concerning the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue, reissued the following year with Virtue or Moral Good replacing Beauty and Virtue. The subtitle of the original edition gave its provenance: In Which the Principles of the Late Earl of Shaftesbury Are Explained and Defended, Against the Author of the Fable of the Bees. It was here that Hutcheson first enunciated the principle, "The greatest happiness for the greatest numbers."[22] Unlike Helvetius and Jeremy Bentham, who are often credited with this principle and who rooted it in the rational calculations of utility, Hutcheson deduced it from morality itself--the "moral sense, viz. benevolence."[23] [* Bentham himself variously attributed this principle to Montesquieu, Barrington, Beccaria, and Helvetius, "but most of all Helvetius." Smith mistakenly attributed the origin of the "moral sense" to Hutcheson rather than Shaftesbury.[24]] These words, "moral sense" and "benevolence," appear as a refrain throughout the book. The moral sense, Hutcheson repeatedly explained, was "antecedent" to interest because it was universal in all men. "Fellow-feeling" could not be a product of self-interest because it involved associating oneself with such painful experiences as the suffering and distress of others. So, too, the "disposition to compassion" was essentially disinterested, a concern with "the interest of others, without any views of private advantage."[25] It was also antecedent to reason or instruction. Like Burke later, Hutcheson warned of the frailty of reason: "Notwithstanding the mighty reason we boast of above other animals, its processes are too slow, too full of doubt and hesitation, to serve us in every exigency, either for our own preservation, without the external senses, or to direct our actions for the good of the whole, without this moral sense."[26] Elsewhere he explained that reason was "only a subservient power," capable of determining the means of promoting the good but not the end itself, the innate impulse to good.[27]<br><br>"Benevolence," compassion," "sympathy," "fellow-feeling," a "natural affection for others"--under one label or another, this moral sense (or sentiment, as Smith preferred) was the basis of the social ethic that informed British philosophical and moral discourse for the whole of the eighteenth century. The generation of philosophers that followed Shaftesbury qualified his teachings in one respect or another, differing among themselves about the precise nature and function of the moral sense. But they all agreed that it (or something very like it) was the natural, necessary, and universal attribute of man, of rich and poor alike, th...</p><h2>Neuroenology: How the Brain Creates the Taste of Wine</h2><p>In his new book, Gordon M. Shepherd expands on the startling discovery that the brain creates the taste of wine. This approach to understanding wine's sensory experience draws on findings in neuroscience, biomechanics, human physiology, and traditional enology. Shepherd shows, just as he did in <i>Neurogastronomy: How the Brain Creates Flavor and Why It Matters</i>, that creating the taste of wine engages more of the brain than does any other human behavior. He clearly illustrates the scientific underpinnings of this process, along the way enhancing our enjoyment of wine.<br><br><i>Neuroenology</i> is the first book on wine tasting by a neuroscientist. It begins with the movements of wine through the mouth and then consults recent research to explain the function of retronasal smell and its extraordinary power in creating wine taste. Shepherd comprehensively explains how the specific sensory pathways in the cerebral cortex create the memory of wine and how language is used to identify and imprint wine characteristics. Intended for a broad audience of readers&#x2015;from amateur wine drinkers to sommeliers, from casual foodies to seasoned chefs&#x2015;<i>Neuroenology</i> shows how the emotion of pleasure is the final judge of the wine experience. It includes practical tips for a scientifically informed wine tasting and closes with a delightful account of Shepherd's experience tasting classic Bordeaux vintages with French winemaker Jean-Claude Berrouet of the Chateau Petrus and Dominus Estate.</p><p><i>Neuroenology</i> is the first book on wine tasting by a neuroscientist.

Either justice will come through us or it will not come at all." John Perkins's optimistic view of justice becoming a reality starts and ends with the Church. <i>With Justice for All</i> is Perkins's invitation to live out the gospel in a way that brings good news to the poor and liberty to the oppressed. This invitation is extended to every racial and ethnic group to be reconciled to one another, to work together to make our land all God wants it to be. And it is a blueprint--a practical strategy for the work of biblical justice in our time. In an age of changing demographics where the need to break the cycle of poverty is staring many of us in the face, Perkins offers hope through practical ministry principles that work. This outstanding resource includes reflection questions for personal or group study as well as interactive sessions for groups to participate in activities together.</p><p>From the author of <i>Let Justice Roll Down</i>, chosen by <i>Christianity Today</i> as one of the top 50 books that have shaped evangelicals, come the 3 Rs of Christian Community Development brought up-to-date for the 21st century&#x2014;Relocation: To be an effective community developer demands relocating into the community of need.

On the one hand, there is an abundance of evidence establishing that the vast majority of Americans, whatever their political differences, have an intense love of their country, believing that it has been one of the most successful experiments in human freedom and opportunity that the world has ever seen. And Americans are similarly united in having a deep reverence for their Constitution, for their institutions of government, and for the system of free enterprise that has been such a powerful engine for our economic growth. Americans see all of these as playing a vital role in making the nation as successful as it has been.</p><p>But there is an equally large body of evidence suggesting that Americans&#x2019; knowledge of their history and of the way in which their institutions have worked over the course of that history is embarrassingly meager. For example, a third of Americans believe that the Declaration of Independence was written after the end of the Civil War, and fewer than half can identify the three branches of our federal government. Nearly 40 percent of the students at fifty-five of America&#x2019;s elite colleges and universities could not place the Civil War in the correct half century, and fewer than half of them, when presented with the text of the Gettysburg Address, were able to identify it. Nor does it appear that our knowledge improves much as we move closer to the present. Another survey has revealed that more than half of high school seniors thought that Italy, Germany, or Japan was a U.S. ally during the Second World War, and only 14 percent of those seniors could name any relevant fact about U.S. involvement in the Korean War. As the distinguished historian David McCullough has lamented, &#x201c;While the clamorous popular culture races on, the American past is slipping away, out of sight and out of mind. We are losing our story, forgetting who we are and what it&#x2019;s taken to come this far.&#x201d;</p><p>With these discouraging results in front of us, it is no wonder that there is a growing clamor for an increased emphasis on &#x201c;civic education,&#x201d; defined by one leading authority as &#x201c;the cultivation of the virtues, knowledge, and skills&#x201d; necessary for carrying out one&#x2019;s role as a citizen. That very phrase, &#x201c;civic education,&#x201d; sounds to many like a doctor&#x2019;s prescription: &#x201c;You need to take your medicine! It may not be very pleasant, but it is something you need to do in order to ensure not only your own health, but also the health of the body politic.&#x201d; It is our hope that reading these volumes in the Penguin Civic Classics series will be much more pleasant than taking medicine, for although these volumes will indeed help improve the reader&#x2019;s civic <i>knowledge</i>, we also hope that they will provide some civic <i>inspiration</i>&#x2014;a genuine appreciation for, even an excitement about, some of the words, ideas, and actions that have shaped American society and government since their founding.</p><p>The history represented in these volumes, from the founding of the American colonies in the seventeenth century to the adoption of America&#x2019;s Declaration of Independence to Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s inspiring Gettysburg Address to Barack Obama&#x2019;s inaugural address as the first African American president in American history, is not merely a collection of names and dates to be memorized but, rather, a set of stories to be absorbed and enjoyed. And they are stories that have a real relevance and meaning to our lives today, whether we are debating the nature of America&#x2019;s immigration laws, the extent to which the federal government should be involved in decisions relating to our health care, or, getting even closer to home, whether local schools and school districts have the constitutional right to search a student&#x2019;s school locker.</p><p>In these volumes, the reader will encounter nearly all of the central themes in American history, as well as the dilemmas and conflicts that have provided much of the dynamism and excitement of that history. The central themes and ideas of American public life&#x2014;democracy, equality, economic opportunity, the role of government in maintaining that delicate balance between public order and personal freedom, and the government&#x2019;s responsibility to protect certain individual rights&#x2014;have never remained static, nor have they ever elicited uniform agreement among American citizens.</p><p>The very first item in Terry Golway&#x2019;s collection of important American speeches is a sermon given by Massachusetts governor John Winthrop, aboard the ship <i>Arbella</i>, as it transported the first Puritan settlers to the new colony. In that sermon, Winthrop described the Puritans&#x2019; mission in Massachusetts Bay as one of creating a &#x201c;city upon a hill,&#x201d; a model of virtue and purity for all others in the world to follow. But his vision of that society was in some important respects very much at odds with the values that guide America today. In the opening words of his sermon, Winthrop reminded his fellow colonists that &#x201c;GOD ALMIGHTY in His most holy and wise providence, hath so disposed of the condition of mankind, as in all times some must be rich, some poor, some high and eminent in power and dignity; others mean and in submission.&#x201d; Hardly a prescription for the democratic society that we claim to be today.</p><p>Fast-forward 136 years to the promise contained in Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s Declaration of Independence that &#x201c;all men are created equal&#x201d;&#x2014;a view of society <i>very</i> different from that articulated by Winthrop. Jefferson&#x2019;s city upon a hill was to be a nation dedicated to equality and the pursuit of happiness, not to a divinely ordained, inegalitarian social hierarchy. But, of course, in a world in which Africans were enslaved, women were considered legally subordinate to men and, indeed, in which many free white males were denied the right to vote because they did not own the requisite amount of property, Jefferson&#x2019;s promise of equality fell far short of an accurate description of the reality of American society in 1776. Still, words have power, and Abraham Lincoln, for one, knew the power of those words. As is amply displayed in Allen Guelzo&#x2019;s volume containing many of Lincoln&#x2019;s principal speeches, time and time again Lincoln invoked Jefferson&#x2019;s preamble as a pledge that Americans of his age were honor-bound to fulfill, describing the preamble as &#x201c;the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together, that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world.&#x201d;</p><p>Alas, Americans would fight a horrific, bloody civil war in which more than 600,000 people, slave and free, lost their lives before the nation was able to take the steps necessary to forge the link to which Lincoln had referred. Beginning in December of 1865, with the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment, eliminating the institution of slavery; continuing with the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment (July 1868), with its guarantee of &#x201c;equal protection under the laws&#x201d;; and culminating with the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment (February 1870), asserting that the right to vote could not &#x201c;be abridged...on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,&#x201d; those ideas of democracy and equality began to be incorporated into our constitutional system. But although those three amendments represented an important step forward, America&#x2019;s struggle to live up to the promise of the preamble was far from over. It took until 1920 for the nation to adopt the Nineteenth Amendment, giving to women the right to vote, and in spite of the guarantees of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, the civil rights of African Americans, including the right to vote, continued to be undermined by the actions of individual state governments well into the twentieth century. When Lyndon Johnson, only the second (after Woodrow Wilson) Southern-born president since the Civil War, signed into law the Voting Rights Act of 1965, he too quoted the preamble to the Declaration and ended his speech with a phrase from the anthem of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s: &#x201c;We Shall Overcome.&#x201d; And when the first African American president, Barack Obama, delivered his inauguration speech on a cold day in January 2009, he began his speech by paraphrasing the words of Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s preamble, urging Americans &#x201c;to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.&#x201d; Even in 2009 those words were, like Jefferson&#x2019;s, expressions of hope, not descriptions of reality. But they have proved powerful indeed, and they continue to be a dynamic force in shaping the American future just as they have the American past.</p><p>Another important theme that emerges from these volumes of Civic Classics involves the age-old debate on how and where to strike the best balance between public order and personal liberty. For most of human history, those who held government power&#x2014;kings or emperors or czars&#x2014;usually dealt with that issue by ruthlessly imposing their own definition of what was good for the masses of people whom they governed. When Thomas Paine published his earth-shaking pamphlet <i>Common Sense</i> in January of 1776, his primary purpose was to persuade the American colonists to throw off British rule, but one of the key elements in his argument was the notion that while every society needs some form of government in order to provide security and protect the freedom of its citizens, the best and freest societies are those in which government is least intrusive. In Paine&#x2019;s words: &#x201c;Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one.&#x201d; Paine&#x2019;s words struck a chord with his American readers, who were already suspicious of the overly powerful, distant government of Great Britain, and the Declaration of Independence, approved seven months later, reinforced that same theme. The distrust of concentrations of government power&#x2014;the notion that government, while necessary, must be restrained&#x2014;is deeply rooted in America&#x2019;s revolutionary past, and, of course, is very much alive today, as we can observe by the vitality of political movements such as the Tea Party.</p><p>As powerful as Paine&#x2019;s and Jefferson&#x2019;s indictments of excessive British power may have been, they did not provide the answer to the question of how the independent American nation could create a government that would strike an ideal balance between order and liberty. The men who gathered in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787 to frame a new constitution for their still-fragile independent nation took a giant step forward in providing an answer when they created a governmental system based on the division of power between the individual states and the central government&#x2014;the system that we now call federalism&#x2014;and by further dividing power among the three branches of the federal government&#x2014;in a system that we characterize as one of &#x201c;checks and balances.&#x201d;</p><p>But, as in so many other important ideas in American history, those involving federalism and checks and balances were subject to many different interpretations. Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, in the eighty-five essays comprising <i>The Federalist Papers</i>, attempted to address some of the concerns that Americans had about the excessive power of the proposed new federal government and, in the process, provided Americans with enduring insights about government and politics&#x2014;insights that are still cited by Supreme Court justices in their judicial opinions even today. But Hamilton and Madison, the two principal authors of <i>The</i> <i>Federalist Papers</i>, began to disagree about the relationship of the new federal government to the individual states and to the people at large almost from the moment the new government commenced operation. The debate over the way the words of the Constitution should be interpreted, with Madison and Jefferson taking a &#x201c;strict construction&#x201d; position, and Hamilton, George Washington, and others arguing for a broader interpretation of the Constitution, has stayed with us until the present day. As readers of Jay Feinman&#x2019;s collection of landmark Supreme Court cases will discover, the Court has spent a significant portion of its time over the years, beginning with Chief Justice John Marshall&#x2019;s majority opinion in <i>McCulloch v. Maryland</i> (1819), wrestling with the extent of and limits on federal government power. Nor has that conflict been confined to judicial or intellectual arguments. In the years leading up to the Civil War, Northern and Southern politicians fought ferocious battles over the question of what authority the federal government had to legislate with respect to the expansion of slavery into ne...</p></p><h2>More Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</h2><p><p><strong>The iconic anthology series of horror tales that's now a feature film!</strong></p><p><strong><em>More Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</em></strong><strong> is a timeless collection of chillingly scary tales and legends.

Born in 1981, Abirached grew up surrounded by the realities of war: Her family's home was close to the demarcation line between East and West Beirut. In her earlier graphic memoir, <em>A Game for Swallows</em> (2012), she focused on a single evening when she and her brother anxiously awaited their parents' return. In this follow-up, Abirached takes inspiration from French experimental writer and filmmaker Georges Perec and forgoes a traditional narrative structure in favor of a catalog of childhood memories, almost all beginning with "I remember." Her memories juxtapose mundane details, such as the "tchic" sound that cassette tapes made when shaken and the three layers that made up old Kit Kat wrappers, with haunting reminders of wartime, such as her brother's shrapnel collection and the bullet holes in the family car. The black-and-white illustrations and inventive layouts ably convey the contrasts of the text. Abirached does not use tones or shading, but her ornate patterns soften the stark contrasts created by her bold lines and her frequent use of black to fill negative space. <strong>Taken together, her many memories create a distinct sense of time, place, and emotion. Meandering and experimental but surprisingly evocative.</strong>" &#x2015;<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Abirached won numerous accolades for her debut, <em>A Game for Swallows </em>(2012), and this follow-up similarly covers her 1980s experiences in Lebanon in a series of vignettes. Each high-contrast black-and white illustration is paired with a memory, from the mundane ('I remember giant robot cartoons') to the profound ('I remember seeing roadblocks made from burnt-out city buses'). The blocky, naive-style pictures quietly evoke wartime fears in ways the words simply cannot&#x2015;bullet holes in the sides of cars, rubble in the streets, her father's eyebrows indicating increasing sadness at the heartbreaking state of a formerly vital market. Perhaps most moving, however, are the illustrations with no words at all&#x2015;a series of plain black pages followed by subtle black-on-white scratchboard illustrations are not paired with a memory, but the spare style, so different from the rest of the book, speaks volumes. <strong>Abirached's childlike memories altogether compose a deeply personal portrait of Beirut unlike any historical account, and for readers curious about conflict in the region, it will provide a useful, humanizing entry point.</strong>" &#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Adopting a simple, straightforward approach, this graphic novel relates a young girl's memories of growing up in war-torn Lebanon. Told from her viewpoint as an adult, and running in roughly chronological order, the narrator describes her experiences in a matter-of-fact, unsentimental manner. 'I remember' is repeated throughout as she describes commonplace experiences (power outages and bombings juxtaposed against birthday parties and bedtime stories). She also relates her sense of wonder when the war quietly ends in 1991, and she and her family can cross the street and walk freely. Stark, b&amp;w illustrations are very effective and help to portray the disconnect between surreal experiences and daily life. The drawings manage to convey a range of emotions while also incorporating humor and subtle nuances. <strong>This spare memoir humanizes families trapped in war zones, and their experiences should resonate with young adult audiences.</strong> [Editor's Note: Available in e-book format and paperback.] <strong>Highly Recommended.</strong>"&#x2015;starred, <em>Library Media Connection</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"In her previous graphic-novel memoir <em>A Game for Swallows</em> (rev. 9/12), Abirached viewed the Lebanese civil war through the lens of a single excruciating evening, as young Zeina awaited her parents' return home amidst heavy bombing. Here <strong>the author revisits that era in a loosely connected series of sobering vignettes and impressions, each beginning with the phrase 'I remember'</strong>: her family's bullet hole&#x2013;riddled car, her brother's shrapnel collection, schools used as bomb shelters. Black-and-white geometric illustrations capture both the enormous scale of the war (with motifs of falling bombs, helicopters, and stranded cars) and its personal repercussions (as facial expressions and body language change subtly over a series of panels). <strong>In one particularly striking spread, Abirached envisions the family's many relocations as the squares of a board game.</strong> Just as in the previous book, lighter memories&#x2015;such as dancing to pop songs, watching cartoons, and receiving disastrous haircuts&#x2015;modulate the somber tone and emphasize that we are seeing things from a child's perspective. Though the 'I remember' refrain becomes a bit repetitive, Abirached smartly subverts it near book's end, admitting what she doesn't remember (e.g., the last day of the war) and adding a framing device (her adult conversation with a friend). Knowledge of <em>Swallows</em> isn't necessary to follow this companion book but would enhance understanding and enjoyment&#x2015;for instance, observant readers may recognize Zeina's eccentric acquaintances." &#x2015;<em>The Horn Book Magazine</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"As with Abirached's debut, <em>A Game for Swallows</em>, this b&amp;w graphic memoir of growing up in Lebanon during that country's civil war invites comparison to <em>Persepolis</em>. Collecting memories introduced via the recurring phrase 'I remember,' <strong>Abirached's prose and artwork convey, with grace and humor, the way her family's life during the war shifted from mundane to ominous and back again.</strong> Her mother tired of getting her windshield replaced every time a shell hit, and she eventually drove without it. There was no water for showers, but an endless supply of cigarettes. Abirached's younger brother assembled a collection of shrapnel, and the author recalls watching the Olympics ('I remember Florence Griffith Joyner's nails'). When an attack forced Abirached, her schoolmates, and teachers to stay at school overnight, she realized that 'our teachers were as scared as we were.' In the middle of her account, Abirached abandons words and uses scratchy white lines on black pages to draw remembered moments of peace: a jar of olives, a swing, a coop full of chickens. Here&#x2015;and throughout&#x2015;<strong>Abirached shares (and readers feel) a loss that cannot be named.</strong>" &#x2015;<em>Publisher Weekly</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>The Writing Class: A Novel (Amy Gallup, 1)</h2><p><p>Amy Gallup was a promising writer once--published and highly praised at twenty-two. It was all downhill from there, and now, year in and year out, she teaches a writing workshop at the local university extension. And this semester begins just the same as the others. But then there's a threatening phone call, followed by obscene threats worked into the student's peer evaluations. Then a murder--and every one of the students is a suspect. The clues are hidden in their writing, and she (and we) can solve the murder only by looking more closely at each writer's attempts at fiction.

That's the premise of this dark comedy of the absurd from Willett (<i>Winner of the National Book Award</i>), a boisterous satire of pseudointellectuals, impotent writers and the adult extension programs of public universities. The only things Amy Gallup, a once-noted California author, has published in years are blurbs of other writers' work. Amy's only income comes from teaching fiction writing to a motley collection of varyingly talented prepublished adults. Someone in the class is making threatening phone calls and sending extremely cruel notes to other students. When two of the students are murdered, a deep sense of danger takes hold. Yet the class goes on. Amy's lectures actually constitute a damn fine guide to writing fiction, while Willett's prose has sparkling moments (The line was playful, offhand, the poem itself a smug, imperious cat stretch). The tension is so strong that readers can hardly resist the temptation to peek ahead and see which student is the killer. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

WHO IS THAT?<br>On the evening of March 27, 1969, my father was in Leningrad, USSR, in pursuit of his advanced electrical engineering degree. My mother was at home, in Sarajevo, deep in labor, attended to by a council of her women friends. She had her hands on her round belly, huffing and crying, but the council didn&#x2019;t seem too worried. I was orbiting around her, exactly four and a half years old, trying to hold her hand or sit in her lap, until I was sent to bed and ordered to sleep. I defied the order so as to monitor the developments through the (somewhat Freudian) keyhole. I was terrified, naturally, for even if I knew that there was a baby in her stomach, I still didn&#x2019;t know how exactly it was all going to work, what was going to happen to her, to us, to me. When she was eventually taken to the hospital in obvious and audible pain, I was left behind with terror-provoking thoughts, which teta-Jozefina tried to counter with the guarantees that my mother would not die, that she would come back with a brother or sister for me. I did want my mother to come back; I did not want a brother or sister; I wanted everything to be the way it was, the way it already used to be. The world had harmoniously belonged to me; indeed, the world had pretty much been me.<br>But nothing has ever been&#x2014;nor will it ever be&#x2014;the way it used to be. A few days later, I was accompanied by a couple of adults (whose names and faces have sunk to the sandy bottom of an aging mind&#x2014;all I know about them is that neither of them was my father, who was still in the USSR) to retrieve my mother from the hospital. One thing I remember: she was not half as happy to see me as I was to see her. On our way home, I shared the backseat with her and a bundle of stuff they claimed was alive&#x2014;that was supposed to be my sister. The alleged sister&#x2019;s face was seriously crumpled, containing only an ugly, indefinable grimace. Moreover, her face was dark, as though she were soot-coated. When I traced my finger across her cheek, a pale line appeared under the soot. &#x201c;She is filthy,&#x201d; I announced to the adults, but none of them acknowledged the problem. From thereon in, it would be hard for me to have my thoughts heard and my needs met. Also, chocolate would be hard to get.<br>Thus my sooty alleged sister&#x2019;s arrival marked the beginning of a tormentful, lonely period in my early development. Droves of people (bringing chocolate I couldn&#x2019;t touch) came to our home to lean over her and produce ridiculous sounds. Few of them cared about me, while the attention they paid to her was wholly, infuriatingly undeserved: she did nothing but sleep and cry and undergo frequent diaper changes. I, on the other hand, could already read small words, not to mention speak fluently, and I knew all kinds of interesting things: I could recognize flags of various countries; I could easily distinguish between wild and farm animals; cute pictures of me were all over our house. I had knowledge, I had ideas, I knew who I was. I was myself, a person, beloved by everyone.<br>For a while, as painful as her existence was to me, she was but a new thing, something you had to get around to get to Mother, like a new piece of furniture or a wilted plant in a large pot. But then I realized that she was going to stay and be a permanent obstacle, that Mother&#x2019;s love for me might never reach pre-sister levels. Not only did my new sister impinge upon what used to be my world, but she also obliviously asserted herself&#x2014;despite having no self at all&#x2014;into its very center. In our house, in my life, in my mother&#x2019;s life, every day, all the time, forever, she was there&#x2014;the soot-skinned not-me, the other.<br>Therefore I tried to exterminate her as soon as an opportunity presented itself. One spring day, Mother stepped out of the kitchen to pick up the phone and left her alone with me. My father was still in Russia, and she was probably talking to him. Mother did stay out of my sight for a while, as I watched the little creature, her unreadable face, her absolute absence of thought or personality, her manifest insubstantiality, her unearned presence. So I started choking her, pressing my thumbs against her windpipe, as seen on television. She was soft and warm, alive, and I had her existence in my hands. I felt her tiny neck under my fingers, I was causing her pain, she was squirming for life. Suddenly, I recognized that I shouldn&#x2019;t be doing what I was doing, I shouldn&#x2019;t be killing her, because she was my little sister, because I loved her. But the body is always ahead of the thought and I kept up the pressure for another moment, until she started vomiting curdled breast milk. I was terrified with the possibility of losing her: her name was Kristina; I was her big brother; I wanted her to live so I could love her more. But, although I knew how I could end her life, I didn&#x2019;t know how I could stop her from dying.<br>My mother heard her desperate cries, dropped the phone, and ran to her aid. She picked my sister up, calmed her down, wiped off the curds, made her inhale and breathe, then demanded an explanation from me. My just-discovered love for my sister and the related feeling of guilt did not at all displace my self-protective instincts: I bold-facedly stated that she&#x2019;d started crying and I&#x2019;d merely put my hand over her mouth to prevent her from bothering Mother. Throughout my boyhood I always knew more and better than my parents thought I did&#x2014;I was always a little older than what they could see. In this instance, I shamelessly claimed good intentions coupled with little-boy ignorance, and so I was warned and forgiven. There is no doubt I was monitored for a while, but I haven&#x2019;t tried to kill Kristina since, loving her uninterruptedly.<br>The recollection of that sororicide attempt is the earliest memory in which I can observe myself from outside: what I see is me <i>and</i> my sister. Never again would I be alone in the world, never again would I have it exclusively for myself. Never again would my selfhood be a sovereign territory devoid of the presence of others. Never again would I have all the chocolate for myself.<br>2. WHO ARE WE?<br>When I was growing up in Sarajevo in the early seventies, the dominant social concept among the kids was <i>raja</i>. If one had any friends at all, one had a <i>raja</i>, but normally the <i>raja</i> was defined by the part of town or the building complex one lived in&#x2014;we spent most of our nonschool time playing in the streets. Each <i>raja</i> had a generational hierarchy. The <i>velika raja</i> were the older kids, whose responsibilities included protecting the <i>mala raja</i>&#x2014;the smaller kids&#x2014;from abuse or pocket-emptying by some other <i>raja</i>. The older kids&#x2019; rights included unconditional obedience on the part of the <i>mala raja</i>, who could thus always be deployed to buy cigarettes, naked-lady magazines, beer, and condoms, or to volunteer their heads for the <i>velika raja</i>&#x2019;s merciless filliping practice&#x2014;my head was often submitted to a cannonade of the dreaded <i>mazzola</i>s. Many <i>raja</i>s were defined by and named after their leader, usually the strongest, toughest kid. We feared, for example, the <i>raja</i> of Ciza, who was a well-known <i>jalija</i>&#x161;, a street thug. Normally, Ciza was old enough to be gainfully invested in various forms of petty crime, so we never saw him. He acquired a mythological quality, while his younger brother Zeko ran the daily operations of doing nothing in particular. It was he who we feared most.<br>My <i>raja</i> was a lesser, weak one, as we had no leader at all&#x2014;all of our older boys, alas, took school seriously. We were defined by a playground between the two symmetrical, socialistically identical buildings in which we lived; we called it the Park. In the geopolitics of our neighborhood (known back then as Stara stanica&#x2014;the Old Train Station) we were known as the Parka&#x161;i. The Park not only contained playground equipment&#x2014;a slide, three swings, sandbox, merry-go-round&#x2014;but there were benches as well, which served as goals whenever we played soccer. There were also, more important, the bushes where we had our <i>loga</i>&#x2014;our base, the place where we could escape from Ciza&#x2019;s marauding <i>raja</i>, where we hoarded things stolen from our parents or pilfered from other, feebler kids. The Park was therefore our rightful domain, our sovereign territory, on which no stranger, let alone a member of another <i>raja</i>, could trespass&#x2014;any suspected foreigner was subject to preemptive frisking or punitive attack. Once we waged a successful campaign against a bunch of teenagers who mistakenly thought that our Park was a good place for smoking, drinking, and mutual fondling. We threw at them rocks and wet sand wrapped in paper, we charged collectively at the isolated ones, breaking long sticks against their legs as they helplessly swung their short arms. Occasionally, some other <i>raja</i> would try to invade and take control of the Park and we would fight a war&#x2014;heads were cracked, bodies bruised, all and any of us risking a grievous injury. Only when Zeko and his troopers&#x2014;our more powerful nemesis&#x2014;came to the Park did we have to stand back and watch them swing on our swings, slide on our slide, piss in our sandbox, shit in our bushes. All we could do was imagine merciless revenge, deferred into an indefinite but certain future.<br>Now it seems to me that when I wasn&#x2019;t in school or reading books, I was involved in some collective project of my <i>raja</i>. Besides protecting the sovereignty of the Park and waging various wars, we spent time at one another&#x2019;s homes, swapped comic books and football stickers, sneaked together into the nearby movie theater (Kino Arena), searched for evidence of sexual activity in our parents&#x2019; closets, and attended one another&#x2019;s birthday parties. My primary loyalty was to my <i>raja</i> and any other collective affiliation was e...</p><h2>The Few: The American &#34;Knights of the Air&#34; Who Risked Everything to Fight in the Battle of Britain</h2><p><i>The Few</i> tells the dramatic and unforgettable story of eight young Americans who joined Britain's Royal Air Force, defying their country's neutrality laws and risking their U.S. citizenship to fight side-by-side with England's finest pilots in the summer of 1940-over a year before America entered the war. Flying the lethal and elegant Spitfire, they became "knights of the air" and with minimal training but plenty of guts, they dueled the skilled and fearsome pilots of Germany's Luftwaffe. By October 1940, they had helped England win the greatest air battle in the history of aviation. Winston Churchill once said of all those who fought in the Battle of Britain, "Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few." These daring Americans were the few among the "few." Now, with the narrative drive and human drama that made <i>The Bedford Boys</i> and <i>The Longest Winter</i> national bestsellers, Alex Kershaw tells their story for the first time.</p><p><b>Alex Kershaw</b> is the author of the widely acclaimed and bestselling books <i>The Bedford Boys</i>, <i>The Longest Winter</i>, and <i>The Few</i>, and two biographies: <i>Jack London</i> and <i>Blood and Champagne: The Life and Times of Robert Capa</i>. He lives in Williamstown, Massachusetts.WWII's Battle of Britain is so tense it is almost suspenseful in Scott Brick's narration of a story that focuses on seven U.S. airmen who risked life, limb, and citizenship to join the British Air Force during the period of U.S. neutrality. Listeners are taken aboard Spitfires, Messerschmitts, and bombers to see it all from the air. Brick is at his best when voicing the memories of the American pilots, but Churchill, Hitler, Goering, and others make appearances. Brick's German accents are a bit stereotypical, but his British upper-crust fly boys and earnest Americans are on target. Daily routines on base and tense air combat scenes are filled with technical and military information. Still the story moves at an amazing clip.

In outward form, <i>Number9Dream</i> is a Dickensian coming-of-age journey: Young dreamer Eiji Miyake, from remote rural Japan, thrust out on his own by his sister&#x2019;s death and his mother&#x2019;s breakdown, comes to Tokyo in pursuit of the father who abandoned him. Stumbling around this strange, awesome city, he trips over and crosses&#x2014;through a hidden destiny or just monstrously bad luck&#x2014;a number of its secret power centers. Suddenly, the riddle of his father&#x2019;s identity becomes just one of the increasingly urgent questions Eiji must answer. Why is the line between the world of his experiences and the world of his dreams so blurry? Why do so many horrible things keep happening to him? What is it about the number 9? To answer these questions, and ultimately to come to terms with his inheritance, Eiji must somehow acquire an insight into the workings of history and fate that would be rare in anyone, much less in a boy from out of town with a price on his head and less than the cost of a Beatles disc to his name.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Number9Dream</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Delirious&#x2014;a grand blur of overwhelming sensation.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;To call Mitchell&#x2019;s book a simple quest novel . . is like calling Don DeLillo&#x2019;s <i>Underworld</i> the story of a missing baseball.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Number9Dream</i>, with its propulsive energy, its Joycean eruption of language and playfulness, represents further confirmation that David Mitchell should be counted among the top young novelists working today.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mitchell&#x2019;s new novel has been described as a cross between Don DeLillo and William Gibson, and although that&#x2019;s a perfectly serviceable cocktail-party formula, it doesn&#x2019;t do justice to this odd, fitfully compelling work.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The New Yorker</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Leaping with ease from surrealist fables to a teenage coming-of-age story and then spinning back to Yakuza gangster battles and World War II&#x2013;era kamikaze diaries, Mitchell is an aerial freestyle ski-jumper of fiction. Somehow, after performing feats of literary gymnastics, he manages to stick the landing.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i></b></p><p>David Mitchell's second novel, <i>Number9Dream</i>, tells the story of Eiji Miyake, a young man negotiating a hypermodern and dangerous Tokyo to meet for the first time his secretive and powerful father. Na�ve and fresh from the Japanese countryside, Eiji encounters every obstacle imaginable in his quest, from his father's--and in-laws'--reluctance for the encounter to occur (Eiji is the bastard son) to fiery entanglements with <i>yakuza</i> (the Japanese mafia) to the overwhelming size and anonymity of Tokyo itself. <p> The novel is cartoonish in that Eiji has a vivid and violent imagination that fills the book with daydreams. When not chain-smoking, forlorn Eiji wanders the city following vague or cryptic leads that invariably dead-end or land him back among yakuza. Mitchell (author of the critically acclaimed <i>Ghostwritten</i>) has a smart, eclectic writing style that seems foreign, and the novel is well paced, but the yakuza encounters are too cinematic, complete with unusual torture and pyrotechnics. Moreover, in addition to Eiji's daydreams, the last half of the book contains excerpts from the diaries of his great uncle's World War II naval heroics and bizarre short stories that Eiji reads while hiding--the latter of which make for tedious reading. </p><p> <i>Number9Dream</i> is crafted from too many disparate components; it does not seem to be a full expression, but an overly crowded one. Readers will sympathize with Eiji and his search, but in the end will wonder what effect, if any, all the extraneous forces had on him. The book provides many fun moments, but ultimately it doesn't really add up to the sum of its parts. <i>--Michael Ferch</i></p><br>Praise for David Mitchell&#x2019;s <i>Ghostwritten</i><br><br>&#x201c;Mitchell . . . has a gift for fiction&#x2019;s natural pleasures&#x2014;intricate surprises, insidiously woven narratives, ingenious voices.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;Mitchell is a fabulous ghostwriter fueled by a brilliant imagination and buoyed by beautifully descriptive writing. <i>Ghostwritten </i>is a brave new book for a brave new world.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>USA Today</i><br><br>&#x201c;To complement its heady themes, G<i>hostwritten</i> is also elegantly composed, gracefully plotted, and full of humor. . . . [It] recall[s] Tolstoy and Dostoevsky in its emotional scope and its ambitions.

In an era in which much literary fiction is characterized by unearned ironies and glib cynicism, it&#x2019;s hard not to be impressed by the humanism that animates Mitchell&#x2019;s book. . . .

It is a thrill to read a piece of fiction this engrossing, challenging, urgent, and ultimately, so very new.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br>&#x201c;Unlike so many other chroniclers of the twenty-first-century pastiche&#x2014;an industry dominated by ad men and feature-writers, not novelists&#x2014;Mitchell has set out to craft actual characters, not archetypes. The result is a dazzling piece of work.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i> <br><br>&#x201c;This is one of the best first novels I&#x2019;ve read for a long time. . . . I read a proof of this on a transatlantic flight. When I got off in Atlanta, I couldn&#x2019;t put it down. I pulled my luggage in one hand along corridors and escalators, and held David Mitchell&#x2019;s last chapter up to my nose with the other. I finished at the carousel. It seemed appropriate.

A unique chronicle of a young man who at one time was both nerd and jock, Tyson&#39;s memoir could well inspire other similarly curious youngsters to pursue their dreams.Like many athletic kids he played baseball, won medals in track and swimming, and was captain of his high school wrestling team. But at the same time he was setting up a telescope on winter nights, taking an advanced astronomy course at the Hayden Planetarium, and spending a summer vacation at an astronomy camp in the Mojave Desert.Eventually, his scientific curiosity prevailed, and he went on to graduate in physics from Harvard and to earn a Ph.D. in astrophysics from Columbia. There followed postdoctoral research at Princeton. In 1996, he became the director of the Hayden Planetarium, where some twenty-five years earlier he had been awed by the spectacular vista in the sky theater.Tyson pays tribute to the key teachers and mentors who recognized his precocious interests and abilities, and helped him succeed. He intersperses personal reminiscences with thoughts on scientific literacy, careful science vs. media hype, the possibility that a meteor could someday hit the Earth, dealing with society&#39;s racial stereotypes, what science can and cannot say about the existence of God, and many other interesting insights about science, society, and the nature of the universe.Now available in paperback with a new preface and other additions, this engaging memoir will enlighten and inspire an appreciation of astronomy and the wonders of our universe.</p><p>Cool, classy, articulate, and brilliant--rarely do all of those adjectives apply at once to an astrophysicist. But Neil de Grasse Tyson is no ordinary scientist; as the director of New York City's Hayden planetarium, his job is to inspire the public with the beauty and grandeur of the universe, just as he was inspired there in his youth. <i>The Sky Is Not the Limit</i> is his memoir of the events leading from his birth to his acceptance of his dream job and beyond, and is a marvelously entertaining look at one man's pursuit of his life's calling. Tyson emphasizes the nurturing roles played by his parents, friends, and teachers, in contrast to the sometimes well-meaning but always disappointing discouragement he experienced from all sides in his quest for his Ph.D.<p> Of course, it's still shamefully difficult for a black American scientist to merit the same quality of attention as his or her peers, and Tyson's insights into the subtle but still-pervasive racism in academia are enlightening. His description of his own shock at seeing himself on television--a black man sought as an expert on something other than being black--is powerfully moving. But, as with his other books, like the gorgeous <i>One Universe: At Home in the Cosmos</i>, the quest for knowledge is more important than the obstacles, and his spirit, determination, and sense of humor prove that the sky really isn't the limit. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>est-ever Director of the Hayden Planetarium, Neil de Grasse Tyson is America's best-known astrophysicist, constantly called upon by the media to explain news-making scientific phenomena such as the discovery of water on Mars. How did an African American kid growing up in the Bronx, expected by everyone to become a star athlete, not an intellectual, become an extraordinarily successful scientist? This is the fascinating and moving account of Tyson's love affair with the night sky, beginning with the fateful day when he, as a small boy, happened to turn a pair of binoculars up toward the moon and was struck with wonder.<br><br>Packed with gorgeous descriptions of the night sky, <b>The Sky Is Not the Limit</b> invokes the grandeur of the cosmos as it tells Tyson's compelling personal story. In addition, it is a perceptive look at life and society as seen through the eyes of an astrophysicist, providing a valuable look into how scientists work in, and think about, the social, political, and ph</p><h2>War Is A Racket; with The War Prayer and The Complaint of Peace</h2><p><p>Major General Smedley D Butler was a military hero of the first rank, the winner of two Medals of Honour, a true 'fighting marine' whose courage and patriotism could not be doubted. Yet he came to believe that the wars in which he and his men had fought and bled and died were all pre-planned conflicts, designed not so much to defend America as to bloat the balance sheets of US banks and corporations. Filled with astounding details of the benefits the few make from the sufferings of the many, 'War is A Racket' is as relevant today as when it was first written. Mark Twain's 'The War Prayer' was considered so explosive by his contemporaries that the short anti-war piece was authorized for publication only after his death. 'The Complaint of Peace' was written in 1521 by Desiderius Erasmus, one of the greatest scholars of his day, as a reaction to the warlike times in which he lived. After an interval of nearly 500 years, this thoughtful critique of war still rings true.</p></p><p></p><h2>Parenting Your First Grader: A Guide to Making the Most of the &#34;Look at Me!&#34; Phase</h2><p><p><b>Parenting Your First Grader</b></p><b> </b><p><b>MAKE THE MOST OF EVERY PHASE IN YOUR CHILD'S LIFE</b></p> <p>You have approximately 936 weeks from the time your child is born until he or she graduates from high school.

Personally, I've raised two successful men that have given me four beautiful grandchildren, all currently under the age of six.

As a&nbsp;gentleman of rank, wealth, and unarguable good looks,&nbsp;he&#x2019;d never received a slight he couldn&#x2019;t simply laugh off.&nbsp;He called every man friend, and no man enemy.&nbsp;<br><br>Until now.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;So that&#x2019;s him.&#x201d; Toby glared at the man twirling a&nbsp;fair- haired beauty across the gleaming parquet&#x2014; Benedict&nbsp;&#x201c;Gray&#x201d; Grayson.

That affable&nbsp;Sir Toby is a phantom of the past, and good riddance&nbsp;to him.

Ever. &#x201c;Congratulations,&nbsp;by the way.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;How did you know Lucy&#x2019;s with child?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Toby made eye contact with his friend&#x2019;s wife across&nbsp;the ballroom, as she weaved through the crush of guests.&nbsp;For years, Lucy Waltham Trescott had dogged their annual&nbsp;hunting excursions at Henry Waltham&#x2019;s estate. She&#x2019;d&nbsp;harbored a girlish infatuation for Toby but had forgotten&nbsp;him quickly enough when Jeremy captured her heart&nbsp;last autumn.&nbsp;<br><br>He said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve three older sisters, and ten nieces and&nbsp;nephews to date. I can tell. A woman&#x2019;s face gets a bit&nbsp;rounder, her hair shines. And her bosom, it . . .&#x201d; Jeremy&nbsp;shot him a glare, and Toby sipped his brandy. &#x201c;Right,&nbsp;well. I can just tell.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Lucy reached them, and Toby fortified his smile. He&#x2019;d&nbsp;be damned if he&#x2019;d let this assembly catch him wearing&nbsp;any expression other than his usual rakish grin.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Toby!&#x201d; Lucy exclaimed, taking his hands. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so&nbsp;glad to see you.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Look at you, Luce.&#x201d; He gave her a sweeping gaze&nbsp;and an appreciative wink. The once- hoydenish twig of a&nbsp;girl had blossomed into the lovely, confident Countess of&nbsp;Kendall. &#x201c;Stunning. Most beautiful lady in the room.&#x201d;&nbsp;Lucy made a dismissive wave of her hand, but behind&nbsp;the gesture she blushed to the ears. Just as he&#x2019;d known&nbsp;she would. Toby leaned in to kiss her cheek, ignoring&nbsp;Jeremy&#x2019;s forbidding glare.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I know you say that to all the ladies,&#x201d; Lucy said. She&nbsp;gave him a cautious look. &#x201c;Sophia looks well, doesn&#x2019;t&nbsp;she?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, she&#x2019;s radiant.&#x201d; Toby forced his grin wider as the&nbsp;Graysons waltzed by, Sophia&#x2019;s flaxen hair and porcelain&nbsp;complexion an elegant ivory blur. &#x201c;Incandescent, even.&nbsp;She has the look of a woman in love.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Sophia had never looked incandescent with him.&nbsp;<br><br>Lucy seemed to read his thoughts. She laid a hand on&nbsp;his sleeve. &#x201c;Toby. You weren&#x2019;t in love with her, either.&#x201d;&nbsp;He shrugged. Lucy spoke the truth, but the truth didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;help.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s done is done. You&#x2019;ve got to move on.&#x201d; Jeremy&nbsp;nodded toward the crush of guests. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a new Season,&nbsp;man. There&#x2019;s a fresh crop of debutantes just waiting to&nbsp;experience the renowned Sir Toby charm. Surely one of&nbsp;them has caught your eye.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Toby considered. True, a fresh conquest might provide&nbsp;a welcome diversion from murderous rage. He&#x2019;d always&nbsp;been a favorite with the debutantes. But lately, there was&nbsp;scarcely any challenge to it. His scandal- sheet notoriety as the &#x201c;Rake Reborn&#x201d; had the mamas on alert and the&nbsp;young ladies in a flutter. All he had to do was appear.&nbsp;&#x201c;Now that you mention it, there was one . . . just one.&#x201d;&nbsp;Toby scanned the ballroom for a glimpse of vibrant&nbsp;emerald silk. There was only one lady who&#x2019;d caught his&nbsp;eye even briefly since he&#x2019;d made his entrance. He knew&nbsp;he&#x2019;d never seen her before&#x2014; he certainly wouldn&#x2019;t have&nbsp;forgotten her if he had.&nbsp;<br><br>Ah, there she was. An intriguing dark- haired beauty&nbsp;unlike any other lady in the room. Unlike any lady he&#x2019;d&nbsp;ever seen. Until now, he&#x2019;d caught only glimpses of her&nbsp;through the churning sea of dancers&#x2014; a flash of emerald,&nbsp;a cascade of raven hair, a swatch of honey- gold skin.&nbsp;Now she lined up with the ladies in preparation for a&nbsp;reel, and he had his first opportunity to study her in full&nbsp;view.&nbsp;<br><br>She was tall. Not nearly so tall as he, but taller than the&nbsp;ladies she stood amongst, and possessed of a lushly proportioned&nbsp;figure. The cut of her gown was modest, but&nbsp;she was the kind of woman who managed to look indecent,&nbsp;even fully clothed. Hers was a body plucked straight&nbsp;from some harem fantasy&#x2014; full breasts, flared hips, long&nbsp;legs.&nbsp;<br><br>Toby watched as she favored her dance partner with&nbsp;the hint of a smile. That subtle curve of her lips was&nbsp;somehow more sensuous than any other curve of her&nbsp;body. Desire sparked through him, surprising him with&nbsp;its intensity. His whole body thrummed with that base,&nbsp;ineloquent instinct in which every seduction, no matter&nbsp;how suave, took its root:&nbsp;<i><br><br>I want that</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>Who was she? She was in her first Season, most certainly.&nbsp;With her beauty, she could not last more than a&nbsp;few months on the marriage mart&#x2014; even if her dowry&nbsp;were made up of cockleshells.&nbsp;<br><br>Toby shifted to view the row of gentlemen lined up&nbsp;opposite, to discern the identity of her partner. &#x201c;Bloody&nbsp;hell.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>It couldn&#x2019;t be. She was partnered with Grayson, the&nbsp;thieving bastard. It wasn&#x2019;t enough he&#x2019;d already stolen&nbsp;the woman Toby had planned to marry&#x2014; now he had to&nbsp;strut and impress the debutantes, too? Damn it, they&nbsp;were Toby&#x2019;s territory. Now what had begun as vague,&nbsp;lustful inclination firmed into a plan:&nbsp;<i><br><br>I want that.&nbsp;<br><br>And I&#x2019;m going to take it.&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;Fancy a reel, Luce?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Why, I had not&#x2014;&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Without waiting for her answer, Toby took Lucy by&nbsp;the hand and tugged her onto the dance floor, wedging&nbsp;their way into the queued- up dancers just instants before&nbsp;the music began. He&#x2019;d positioned himself at&nbsp;Grayson&#x2019;s shoulder, and though he bowed to Lucy as the&nbsp;first chords were struck, he kept his gaze slanted toward&nbsp;the beauty in green silk beside her.&nbsp;<br><br>The dance was one patterned in groups of three couples,&nbsp;requiring much interchange between adjacent partners,&nbsp;just as Toby had hoped. At regular intervals, he would&nbsp;have occasion to take his emerald- clad vision by the&nbsp;hand, exchange a few words, twirl her dizzy, and&#x2014; if all&nbsp;that failed to render her breathless&#x2014; flash his most winning&nbsp;smile.&nbsp;<br><br>But all in good time.&nbsp;<br><br>Winning over a lady was a matter of strategy, of patience.&nbsp;The first contact must not be skin- to- skin, nor&nbsp;even glove- to- glove, but solely eye- to- eye. Toby moved&nbsp;forward to bow to her, his gaze riveted to hers. Her eyes&nbsp;were remarkable. Wide- set, almond- shaped, and fringed&nbsp;with sable lashes. So large and serious, they seemed to&nbsp;swallow up the rest of her face. For a moment, he let&nbsp;himself sink into those dark, placid pools.&nbsp;<br><br>He had a dev il of a struggle fishing himself back out.&nbsp;<br><br>A few bars later, he was still recovering when the pattern&nbsp;compelled him to take her hand. He seized her&nbsp;gloved fingers firmly. The soft fabric heated between&nbsp;them as they circled, becoming warm and pliant as skin.&nbsp;Her bare flesh would feel like this, he thought. Satinsmooth.&nbsp;Supple. Hot to the touch as his hands glided&nbsp;under that cool silk to explore her every enticing curve.&nbsp;It would have the texture of cream against his tongue.&nbsp;Lord. Toby hauled on his mental reins before those&nbsp;thoughts carried him away. Never before had he felt such&nbsp;a thrill simply taking a lady&#x2019;s hand. But then, never before&nbsp;had he seduced a woman straight from the arms of his&nbsp;enemy.&nbsp;<i><br><br>&#x201c;Toby.&#x201d; </i>Lucy beckoned him with a twitch of her fingers,&nbsp;and Toby realized they&#x2019;d fallen behind in the pattern.&nbsp;&#x201c;Right. Beg pardon.&#x201d; He leapt forward to claim Lucy&#x2019;s&nbsp;hands and sweep her down the dance. &#x201c;And I apologize&nbsp;in advance, for what is about to occur.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Her eyes flared. &#x201c;Toby, no. You can&#x2019;t make a scene.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, but I could. I could denounce Grayson and&nbsp;Sophia in front of the entire ballroom. Everyone thinks&nbsp;they&#x2019;re the golden couple, the freshly knighted hero and&nbsp;his beautiful, innocent bride? I could expose the truth.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;And I could expose your innards.&#x201d; Lucy&#x2019;s fingernails&nbsp;dug into his arm, proving a fierce huntress still prowled&nbsp;within that elegant exterior. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t dare. I&#x2019;ve&nbsp;been planning this eve ning for months, Toby.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The dance parted them before Toby could respond.&nbsp;Then the lady in green silk smiled, and something in his&nbsp;chest pulled tight. He couldn&#x2019;t have spoken if he&#x2019;d tried.&nbsp;It was perfect, that smile, composed of full, sensuous lips&nbsp;the color of fine Madeira. Lips designed for sin, framing&nbsp;an innocent row of pearly teeth. And about the corners&nbsp;of her mouth, the slightest hint of melancholy&#x2014; just&nbsp;enough to intrigue the mind, stir the heart. Those lips&nbsp;defied mere admiration; they wanted a kiss.&nbsp;<br><br>There was only one thing wrong with that smile.&nbsp;<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t directed at him. That bastard Grayson was&nbsp;its lucky recipient, and it was all Toby could do not to&nbsp;thrust out his boot and trip the man as he moved forward&nbsp;to take the beauty&#x2019;s hands.&nbsp;<br><br>Tempting, that idea&#x2014; but inconceivable. Toby might&nbsp;scuff his boot.&nbsp;<br><br>No, he would exact his revenge more subtly, more&nbsp;justly. No messy duel, no public denouncement. Did not&nbsp;the Bible advise an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth . . .&nbsp;or, in this case, a lady for a lady?&nbsp;<br><br>When the pattern brought them together again, he&nbsp;pulled his dark- haired temptress close&#x2014; so close the&nbsp;green silk of her gown tangled with his legs. Her scent&nbsp;teased him: a crisp, fresh- smelling blend of verbena and&nbsp;citrus.&nbsp;<br><br>Tightening his grip on her arm, he whispered just as&nbsp;they parted: &#x201c;I must tell you a secret.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>He squeezed her fingers before releasing them, allowing&nbsp;his thumb to brush the sensitive center of her palm.&nbsp;<br><br>He fancied he heard her gasp.&nbsp;<br><br>Grayson cast him a wary look. Toby&#x2019;s arrogance made&nbsp;a feast of it.&nbsp;<br><br>He turned back to the lady in green. &#x201c;You will be&nbsp;shocked,&#x201d; he murmured as they brushed by one another&nbsp;again, &#x201c;but it cannot be helped.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>He did not imagine her gasp that time, nor the flush&nbsp;that bloomed from her hairline to her bosom. Lord, she&nbsp;had the most magnificent bosom, and now it was lifting&nbsp;slightly with her every breath, straining the seams of her&nbsp;bodice. Tearing his eyes from the sight was quite possibly&nbsp;the most difficult thing he&#x2019;d ever done.&nbsp;<br><br>An eternity passed before the pattern re united them.&nbsp;Toby dutifully twirled and promenaded, avoiding Lucy&#x2019;s&nbsp;inquisitive glances by watching <i>her </i>instead. Within him,&nbsp;bitter envy twined with lust. Admiration glowed on her face as she regarded her partner. He despised Grayson&nbsp;more every moment.&nbsp;<br><br>When at last he rejoined the lady in green, it was with&nbsp;profound, bone- deep relief.

The first edition sold more than 20,000 copies. The Second Revised Edition 2016 -- now in its second printing -- is published by North Sails Group, LLC and written by the same duo. What a difference 25 years makes! Today there are one-piece sails made over a 3D mold in the shape they will assume in the wind. Sail plans have radically evolved to fractional rigs, fat-head mains, and non-overlapping jibs. That is true for racing boats as well as cruising. Thus, ninety percent of the text is new, as are almost all of the more than 100 photographs and technical illustrations. <br><br>The authors focus on circulation as they did in the first edition, but now come at it from a different direction. And for the first time anywhere, they attempt to quantify its effects. Where the wind speeds up and why as it passes over a sail plan, and where it slows down and why. Circulation theory is familiar to aerodynamicists for at least 100 years and is argued about by sailors at least since 1973, when the late Arvel Gentry loosed his theories on the sailing world. Gentry was an aerodynamicist at Boeing by day and a sailor on the weekends. And the theories used to explain why airplanes fly were at odds with the theories of why sailboats sail to weather and what the slot actually does. <br><br>Whidden, CEO of North Marine Group, which includes North Sails, and Levitt, who has written 14 books, utilize explanations like circulation to answer such diverse questions as: <br>� Why fractional rigs, fat-head mains, and non-overlapping jibs have come to predominate. <br>� Why and how leech twist can be a sail-trimmer's best friend. <br>� Why a yacht designer positions the mast, keel, and rudder to create some weather helm. <br>� Why the safe-leeward position is advantageous relative to the entire fleet, not just to the boat you tacked beneath and forward of. <br>� Why a mainsail's efficiency is improved with added upper roach, beyond the value of the extra area. <br>� Why the miracle of upwind sailing is not that there is so much lift but so little drag. <br>� Why, when sailing upwind, the main is always trimmed to a tighter angle than the jib. <br>� What a polar diagram tells us or why tacking downwind is almost always faster than sailing directly to a mark.<br><br>There is also an in-depth look at the wonders of material utilization&#x2015;not just materials. Indeed there have been no new fibers accepted into sailmaking for over 20 years. It is how they are used that makes the difference. In the last three chapters, the authors drill down on mainsails, headsails, and downwind asymmetric and symmetric spinnakers. And in this edition for the first time they address downwind aerodynamics. The book celebrates the complexity and beauty of sails in words and pictures and of the whole rarefied sport of sailing.</p><p>Tom Whidden is CEO of North Technology Group, owner of North Sails, Southern Spars, Future Fibres, and Edgewater Powerboats.

If you&#x2019;re feeling slow, you&#x2019;ll know where to go., <i>Sailing World, January 13, 2017</i><br><br>The subject of sails and sailmaking can be quite complex but in this terrific revised edition of The Art and Science of Sails authors Tom Whidden and Michael Levitt have done a superb job distilling the complexities into a narrative that we can all understand. From the intricacies of how wind and water conspire to propel a boat forward to some of the more mundane aspects of sails, this book covers it all and in great detail. I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone who wants to know more about that very important part of a sailboat, namely the sails. Twenty six years ago the original The Art and Science of Sails was published and it was a ground breaking book... Who would have guessed back then that the America's Cup would be raced in flying boats with solid sails? One of the most interesting chapters of the book is The Science of Sails; how indeed can a flimsy curved surface propel a boat almost directly into the wind? It seems unfathomable but it's true, and Whidden and Levitt walk the reader step by step through the various stages of, as they put it &#x201c;flying a flat plate,&#x201d; to a complete understanding of aerodynamic theory. They then take this theory and explain how it translates into designing and engineering sails. There is significant ink given to 3DL and 3Di sailmaking and for good reason. Building membrane sails on a full size mold completely revolutionized the industry, and these days it's not only the racers that want this kind of technology, increasingly cruisers are also seeking it out. By being able to precisely lay fibers along the anticipated load lines in a sail meant that sails could be built lighter and stronger for the same stretch resistance. Incorporating exotic fibers such as carbon and vectran into sailmaking further advanced things and now blending different fibers into the same sail with each doing their own part all found their roots with 3DL.I urge you to read the whole book cover to cover like I did. Sailors around the world spend an inordinate amount of money on sails and without being disparaging many have no real clue how to use them. I can almost guarantee that your skills as a sailor will be vastly improved once you have read this book. -- Brian Hancock, Owner of Great Circle Sails and author of Maximum Sail Power, <i>Sail Magazine's Sailfeed, November 17, 2016</i><br><br>This book is the second iteration of the Art and Science of Sails written by a wonderful sailing journalist Michael Levitt and Tom Whidden, a distinguished North Sails veteran. I took it on wanting to understand more about what drove those boats we raced and how we could squeeze one more ounce of speed. The sport has changed dramatically and this book is a solid portrayal of the journey and change in approach, technology, vision and design. In essence it sets the record straight for many of us who were possibly too close to the forest to see the real evolution and its rapid pace of change. Whidden's personal story is intriguing. I loved the approach, the setting of a baseline, the linkages to Hood and North and the contrasts of their inherent strengths, the working through the materials and the technical meat of the book in the transitioning from as they put it &#x201c;from aerodynamic theory to practice.&#x201d; It's often said one of the things that separate great books, especially ones that deal with topics that are technical in nature, from the pack is a style that truly engages and teaches... Simply said this is a must book for your sailing library. -- John Kerr, John Kerr is the managing Partner at AD ASTRA Media publishing Canadian Yachting., <i>Canadian Yachting, 10/23/2016</i><br><br>Twenty-Five years ago, these authors published the first version of this book. As they note, in the quarter-century, there has been many amazing advances in sail design and construction. Published by North Sails, this book is stuffed with full of theory and discussion of how sails work. It has sections on theory, materials, design, use of sails, as well as the use of computers in sail design and manufacture. There are also distinct chapters on headsails and mainsails. There are also substantial chapters on the advances that North Sails has made since the late 1980s, specifically 3DL and 3Di sails. It absolutely benefits from the personal knowledge of the authors, and their involvement with North Sails. This book is clearly written for people who are interested in the cutting-edge sail design and manufacture techniques, specifically as applied to racing sailboats. It does not address square rigs at all. It is beautifully printed, and is filled with really interesting diagrams and photos that illuminate the text. This is highly recommended for racers, and also for anybody who is interested in how sails work, and modern sailmaking. It is suitable for all levels of experience., <i>The Nautical Mind, 10/12/2016</i><br><br>Tom Whidden and Michael Levitt's legendary reference work on the art and science of sails has received a complete and well-researched update., <i>Seahorse Magazine, 10/2016</i><br><br>Tom Whidden and Michael Levitt's book is a clear, reliable guide to getting the most out of your sails, an essential component to good seamanship whether you're cruising or racing. -- John Rousmaniere, Sailor and author,The Great Atlantic, The New York Yacht Club: A History and many other books<br><br>A fascinating look at the science and history that has led us to today's highly technical world of sailmaking. The book does a wonderful job of explaining the physics behind both trimming of sails and state-of-the-art sailmaking. -- Bora Gulari, Two-time Moth World Champion and U.S. Sailing Rolex Yachtsman of the Year<br><br>Christmas is drawing near, and with it the question: what gifts should I give?

Through a blend of theoretical and tacit knowledge, this text offers students an in-depth guide to 1) how to successfully communicate with both internal and external school entities, 2) how to build and maintain positive and active relationships via social and political capital and 3) how to translate the value of these relationships into positive change within the school. While exploring these three central themes, the book emphasizes how new technologies can aid school success. At the same time, real-world case studies at the beginning of each chapter introduce readers to actual public relations issues and bring the material to life. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The revised fifth edition of <i>Public Relations in Schools </i>is updated with new materials and references throughout the text, including two new chapters &#x2013; one on harnessing technology for your public relations needs and one on collecting, assessing, and applying public opinion. In addition, the new fifth edition text contains a matrix at the front of the book showing how content relates to ELCC/NCATE Standards ��&#x2013; the widely used criteria for administrator preparation and licensing.</p></p><p><p>By emphasizing the importance of two-way communication, this book offers a broad yet unique perspective on the importance of successful public relations programs in schools by integrating theory and knowledge. A public relations program is about building and maintaining relationships through an open exchange of information, and this book teaches administrators, regardless of their assignment, how communication and relationships directly affect organizational behavior, and ultimately, school success. The concept of relational communication, added to this edition, emphasizes the importance of consciously using communication as a means to construct these relationships. From the concept of public relations itself, and its legal and ethical dimensions, to assessing applications of public relations that pose challenges to the effectiveness of programs, this text is extremely relevant for students preparing to be administrators and for those professionals already practicing. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This edition is organized into three sections that thoroughly examine contemporary perspectives on the application of public relations in educational settings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Features include:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li> A <b>new chapter on technology</b> addresses the expanded use of technology in school public relations, with specific attention given to how the Internet, web pages, and blogs can be developed and used to improve communication and relationships. </li> <li> A <b>new focus on public opinion</b> teaches administrators the different processes of measuring public opinion and how to apply these findings to make effective and essential decisions. </li> <li> <b>Expanded information on school-community relationships</b>, specifically emphasizing the need for a positive, mutual relationship between the school and the community </li> <li> <b>Introductory case studies</b> that not only encourage professional reflection, but also ensure relevance by viewing current social and political conditions through a personal perspective </li> <li> <b>Questions and suggested activities</b> at the end of each chapter encourage in-class discussions while also promoting critical thinking.&nbsp; </li> <li> A <b>matrix</b> has been added to show how the chapter content relates to Educational Leadership Constituent Council (ELCC) and National Council for Teacher Accreditation (NCATE) Standards. </li> </ul><p> <b>Theodore J.

To explore the latter, he invents the allegory of the cave to illustrate his notion that ordinary men are like prisoners in a cave, observing only the shadows of things, while philosophers are those who venture outside the cave and see things as they really are, and whose task it is to return to the cave and tell the truth about what they have seen. This dynamic metaphor expresses at once the eternal conflict between the world of the senses (the cave) and the world of ideas (the world outside the cave), and the philosopher's role as mediator between the two.</p><p></p></p><h2>Reading Research in Action: A Teacher&#39;s Guide for Student Success</h2><p><p>Teachers asked for it: a practical, no-nonsense book that shows them how to use scientifically based reading research (SBRR) in their everyday classroom instruction and improve their students' literacy outcomes.

The airplane won&#x2019;t push past the gray and blue to reach the endless black called outer space. So I have to take control.</p><p>I press my back against the seat, push up my glasses, close my eyes, and pretend the plane is aiming for the stars and planets and the very edge of our galaxy. The seatback in front of me is the control board, and I press button after button as the plane blasts through the concrete sky and becomes the Mothership <i>Uhura</i>. It&#x2019;s star date 06.23.1984 and&nbsp;I&#x2019;m now E-Grace Starfleet, space cadet, on a mission to rescue the great and wise Captain Fleet!</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming for you, Captain Fleet!&#x201d; I whisper to myself.</p><p>The clouds part as the <i>Uhura</i> achieves Earth&#x2019;s orbit. Then, in just a few milliseconds, I calculate the hyperspace jump all the way out to Andromeda. This part sometimes makes me queasy because warp speed forces time and space to squeeze my whole body&#x2014;along with this morning&#x2019;s breakfast rolling around in my belly&#x2014;into an opening smaller than the eye of a needle. I&#x2019;ve never thrown up while on the Mothership<i>Uhura</i>. Until now.</p><p>Someone touches my shoulder, and I blink right back into the present, back onto this American Airlines Boeing 727, headed for New York City.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you all right, honey?&#x201d; the stewardess asks. &#x201c;You look a little sick.&#x201d;</p><p>I shake my head because my stomach is a whirling black hole ready to spew out long lost spacecraft and missing astronauts. The stewardess hands me a bag just in time and up come Momma&#x2019;s grits and cheese and ham and eggs.</p><p>There&#x2019;s nothing more human than throwing up.</p><p>Suddenly, I don&#x2019;t feel like Space Cadet E-Grace Starfleet anymore. Even in this airplane that&#x2019;s supposed to be &#x201c;something special in the air,&#x201d; I&#x2019;m just regular ol&#x2019; Ebony-Grace Norfleet Freeman, rising seventh-grader from Huntsville, Alabama. There&#x2019;s nothing out-of-this-world about a too-stiff white shirt, ugly pleated skirt, lace-trimmed socks, a greasy press &#x2019;n&#x2019; curl, big ol&#x2019; glasses, and a tummy that feels like volcanic explosions on the surface of Mars.</p><p>I lean against the window to look out at the concrete sky, so incredibly close to outer space. The white lady across the aisle thinks I don&#x2019;t notice her watching me out of the corner of her eye as she lights a cigarette. Maybe she thinks it will settle my stomach. I take off my glasses, place them on my lap, and close my eyes again.</p><p>When has the brave and powerful Captain Fleet ever needed saving? Never ever. Not when the Sonic King threatened to destroy the<i>Uhura</i> with a single meteor. Not when his evil little minions, the Funkazoids, led Captain Fleet on a wild-goose chase all over Planet Boom Box. And not even when Momma made Granddaddy promise to &#x201c;stop filling her head with crazy stories since she&#x2019;ll be in junior high school soon!&#x201d;</p><p>But now I am the farthest I&#x2019;ve ever been from Captain Fleet in my whole entire life. He has no one to help him when he faces the evil Sonic King. He is all alone as I make my way to New York City.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course the Sonic King took the opportunity to capture the great and wise Captain Fleet once and for all,&#x201d; I whisper to myself.</p><p>This is where Granddaddy&#x2019;s stories ended before I left for a whole week in New York City. And maybe this is where they&#x2019;ll end forever since I am becoming a young lady and it is &#x201c;time to do away with comic books and childish stories,&#x201d; as Momma said before I left.</p><p>But Granddaddy doesn&#x2019;t always keep his promises to Momma.</p><p>&#x201c;Promise me I won&#x2019;t be gone for too long, Granddaddy,&#x201d; I had told him before I left.</p><p>&#x201c;And promise me E-Grace Starfleet will rescue that old Captain Fleet from the hands of the evil Sonic King,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d replied.</p><p>Granddaddy may not always keep his promises to Momma, but we always keep our promises to each other.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming for you, Captain Fleet,&#x201d;<i> </i>I say aloud. I don&#x2019;t even care if the white lady across the aisle looks at me sideways.</p><p>Slowly, the clouds begin to part and reveal New York City&#x2019;s skyscrapers&#x2014;the Twin Towers, the Empire State Building, and the Chrysler Building. Somewhere on those streets, John Lennon got shot. A lot of people get shot in New York City. Back in Huntsville, I would always run to the TV whenever I heard Pam Carleton and Robert Lane start their Nightcast Weekend News report on Channel 48 with all the very bad, terrible, and awful things happening in New York City. And I&#x2019;d think of Daddy. But Momma always sent me out of the room before the news report finished. She does that almost every time the news talks about New York City.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want you hearing about all that sinning going on up there in that town. You can come back down when Reverend Swaggart is on,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say with her hard-candy voice.</p><p>&#x201c;No, thank you, Momma,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d say as I stomped back up to my room. Hearing about sin in New York City was way more fun than listening to Jimmy Swaggart sing sad songs about Baby Jesus.</p><p>I put my glasses back on, tighten my seat belt, and search all around my mind&#x2014;my &#x201c;imagination location,&#x201d; as Granddaddy calls it&#x2014;for a new name for this planet, a funky one with lots of soul, as Granddaddy would insist. Planet No Joke City echoes in my mind as if it was coming straight from Granddaddy himself. Ain&#x2019;t nothing funny about No Joke City!</p><p>I let out a deep, ringing laugh just like my granddaddy&#x2019;s.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not until the stewardess comes over to tell me that we&#x2019;ll be landing in twenty minutes that I start thinking about Daddy and his junkyard in Harlem, and my New York City best friend, Bianca Perez.</p><p>Last Tuesday when he called, Daddy sounded happy to have me for a whole week, even though he promised Momma that this time he&#x2019;d sign me up for a day camp with ballet classes, piano lessons, and math enrichment, as well as making sure that I get to a good church on Sunday. But he&#x2019;d also secretly promised me that he&#x2019;d let me play in the junkyard, even if it meant getting in trouble with Momma.</p><p>Momma had been eavesdropping on the other phone line. &#x201c;Julius, you better keep Ebony-Grace away from all those greasy men and little street urchins!&#x201d;</p><p>If Daddy keeps his promise to Momma and signs me up for day camp, I won&#x2019;t see Bianca the whole time I&#x2019;m there. She&#x2019;ll be stuck in her tiny apartment with no TV helping her grandmother sew dresses for rich ladies. Bianca&#x2019;s definitely gonna need my help, too.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming for you, Bianca Pluto!&#x201d; I say under my breath. Surely, I can use a bigger crew to help on the<i>Uhura</i>, and Bianca Pluto has already proven herself to be a worthy first officer.</p><p>When the airplane finally touches down, I squeeze my eyes shut and I&#x2019;m on the<i>Uhura</i> orbiting Planet No Joke City. I promise myself not to laugh after I beam down or else the aliens will recognize E-Grace Starfleet and take her prisoner. So before the airlock opens, I let out a giggle that becomes a chuckle that turns into an avalanche of big, bright joy. I laugh until I am a bubble floating up into zero gravity.</p><p>&#x201c;Ebony-Grace. We have to exit the plane now. Do you need help with your things?&#x201d; The stewardess&#x2019;s voice pulls me back down to Earth.</p><p>She is not smiling, so I quickly stop laughing.</p><p>When I step off the plane and walk through a long, narrow, dimly lit hallway, no one welcomes me, there&#x2019;s no parade for E-Grace Starfleet, the granddaughter of the brave and powerful space hero, Captain Fleet. No cheers, no laughter, no joy.</p><p>Ain&#x2019;t nothing funny in No Joke City, all right.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Lyndon B. Johnson: Portrait of a President</h2><p>Robert Dallek's brilliant two-volume biography of Lyndon Johnson has received an avalanche of praise. Michael Beschloss, in <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>, said that it "succeeds brilliantly." <em>The New York Times</em> called it "rock solid" and <em>The Washington Post</em> hailed it as "invaluable." And Sidney Blumenthal in <em>The Boston Globe</em> wrote that it was "dense with astonishing incidents." <br><br>Now Dallek has condensed his two-volume masterpiece into what is surely the finest one-volume biography of Johnson available. Based on years of research in over 450 manuscript collections and oral histories, as well as numerous personal interviews, this biography follows Johnson, the "human dynamo," from the Texas hill country to the White House. We see LBJ, in the House and the Senate, whirl his way through sixteen- and eighteen-hour days, talking, urging, demanding, reaching for influence and power, in an uncommonly successful congressional career. Then, in the White House, we see Johnson as the visionary leader who worked his will on Congress like no president before or since, enacting a range of crucial legislation, from Medicare and environmental protection to the most significant advances in civil rights for black Americans ever achieved. And we see the depth of Johnson's private anguish as he became increasingly ensnared in Vietnam.<br><br>In these pages Johnson emerges as a man of towering intensity and anguished insecurity, of grandiose ambition and grave self-doubt, a man who was brilliant, crude, intimidating, compassionate, overbearing, driven: "A tornado in pants."

This crew of explorers landed on the opposite side of Antarctica from the Endurance with a mission to build supply depots for Shackleton&#x2019;s planned crossing of the continent. But their ship disappeared in a gale, leaving ten inexperienced, ill-equipped men to trek 1,356 miles in the harshest environment on earth. Drawing on the men&#x2019;s own journals and photographs, <i>The Lost Men</i> is a masterpiece of historical adventure, a book destined to be a classic in the vein of <i>Into Thin Air</i>.<br><br></p></p><p>Kelly Tyler-Lewis, a historian, is Visiting Scholar of the Scott Polar Research Institute of the University of Cambridge, England. Her research took her to Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica, where she spent two months with the U.S. Antarctic Program.Everyone knows the story of Shackleton's failed Antarctic trek and his heroic efforts to save his men. But how many know about the Ross sea party on the other side of the continent, charged with delivering food supplies for Shackleton? They too were left stranded for two years after their ship was ripped from its moorings and swept away. Despite abandonment, the party made one of the longest continuous land journeys in the history of Antarctic exploration, sledging a record 1700 miles to lay the depots. Graeme Malcolm's graceful reading is empathetic and evocative. He uses his British accent to depict various social classes in the diary entries; however, Australians prove a bit of a challenge.

There was a fine, light summer wind sweeping down the London street where Nan Killian, her friend Sarah Lyon-White, their raven, their parrot, and their ward Suki lived. It frisked in through the open windows of their flat, bringing with it the scent of the daffodils blooming in the flowerboxes outside their window, a scent that just managed to counter the less pleasant odors of London as summer began. At this time of the day there was minimal traffic outside, but you could have heard a pin drop in the sitting room. Not even the birds were feeling chatty.</p><p>Sarah, Nan, and Suki sat on the sofa on one side of the cold hearth; their friends and fellow occultists John and Mary Watson sat on the matching sofa on the other. Between the sofas, the table was laden with tea-things, completely untouched so far. Mary was dressed in full mourning, and John had a mourning band around his upper arm.</p><p>John was, in Nan's estimation, a very fine looking gentleman. He kept himself in shape, and the hard line of his jaw gave the lie to the kindness of his eyes. His wife Mary was not a beauty, the way Nan's friend Sarah was, but she was something between "pretty" and "handsome," and her own expression was generally as kind as her husband's.</p><p>Nearly a month ago a mysterious telegram addressed to both of them had arrived from Germany. Unsigned, it had said merely this: Do not believe what you read.</p><p>Then, before either of them had been able to find John or Mary Watson, both of whom were out of London, or consult with Lord Alderscroft-the what of the mysterious message became clear, as within hours headlines across London screamed SHERLOCK HOLMES DEAD!</p><p>Alderscroft, when they finally contacted him, knew nothing. Mycroft Holmes was unreachable. And John and Mary, when at last they appeared in London again, were no help. They went into outward mourning. John Watson simply said in print that Holmes had had a "misadventure" in Germany, and had fallen to his death at the Reichenbach Falls-in private, he thinned his lips and gave the girls a look that suggested they needed to go along with that story.</p><p>Mary Watson sent around a brief note a week ago suggesting they should gather for a wake for Holmes, but oddly specified the girls' flat, not 221B nor one of their own flats-neither the seldom-used one above John's surgery nor their real home at 221C. So here they were, regarding one another across a laden tea table covered with cups and edibles that no one had touched, silently staring at one another. Even the birds, sitting behind the girls on their perches, were uncharacteristically silent. No one had said a word aside from the initial greetings. To say that the atmosphere was "strained" was something of an understatement.</p><p>Of course, Nan could probably have used her mental powers to read John's mind, or Mary's-but Sarah and Nan had discussed that, and without their permission, that was something Nan simply would not do, and nothing either of the Watsons had said or done had indicated to her that she had said permission.</p><p>And as for Sarah, her mediumistic talents were not of much use here.</p><p>So for the course of the last month, they had alternated between being certain that it had been Holmes who had sent that telegram, and that he was alive and well, and certain that it had been a mistake or a cruel hoax, and their dear friend Sherlock Holmes was dead.</p><p>"Tea?" Sarah ventured, breaking the silence. But before either of the Watsons could answer, they were interrupted by the sound of the bell downstairs.</p><p>All of them started, and strained their ears. Mrs. Horace, the girls' landlady, answered the door on the second pull of the bell. There was the sound of quiet murmuring, then footsteps, two sets, coming up the stairs to the girls' flat.</p><p>Mrs. Horace tapped on the door, and opened it. "A Mrs. Stately to see you," she said, in tones that suggested she felt very doubtful about their visitor. "She says she is here on invitation from the Watsons."</p><p>"Show her in, thank you, Mrs. Horace," Nan replied before Sarah could say anything. The door opened fully, and a hunched old lady-at least, Sarah thought she was old-clad head to toe in black, with a black veil, entered the room. Mrs. Horace closed the door.</p><p>And as soon as the door was firmly closed, the old lady suddenly stood up straight, gaining almost a foot in height, pulled back her veil, and revealed the face of Sherlock Holmes.</p><p>Sarah stared; she would have sworn that a moment ago the face beneath that veil had been pinched and wizened, and nothing at all like Holmes-save, perhaps, in the beaky nose. But now, there was no doubt-although Holmes looked thinner than usual, and a bit more pale. Still, it was Sherlock Holmes.</p><p>Mary and John just looked as if an enormous burden had been taken from their shoulders. Suki squealed, and threw herself at Holmes; he smiled very slightly and patted her on the back as she hugged his skirts. The birds both flew to Holmes as well, landing one on each shoulder, Grey bending down to gently mouth the top of Holmes' nose, and Neville pressing himself up against the side of Holmes' head. Nan felt like flinging herself at Sherlock as well, but what he tolerated in children and animals made him uncomfortable when coming from adults, so she confined herself to sighing as she felt a surge of unimaginable relief.</p><p>Then, suddenly, John burst out laughing. "By Jove, I get it. Stately Holmes, indeed!"</p><p>Sherlock smiled slightly and took a seat on the one remaining chair, as Suki returned to the girls and the birds to their perches. "The last four weeks have been unpleasant enough for all of us that I thought I might amuse you with a small pun." He lost the smile. "Unfortunately, the unpleasantness is just beginning."</p><p>"Wait!" Nan said, before he could continue. "Before you do that, for heaven's sake, tell us what happened! Why did you and John vanish? What happened in Germany? Why did you pretend to be killed? You did send us that telegram, didn't you?"</p><p>Holmes raised an eyebrow and glanced down at the laden tea table significantly. Sarah hastened to pour out for everyone, while Nan passed around ham sandwiches and cakes, the birds returned to their perches for their shares, and only when Holmes had eaten and drunk did he put his cup aside and begin,</p><p>"I have been on very short commons these last few days," he said by way of apology for eating more than half the sandwiches all by himself. "Well, to begin at the beginning, you will recall my campaign against that villain, Professor Moriarty, and his fiendish gang?"</p><p>They all nodded.</p><p>"Last month, the campaign had nearly reached its ultimate goal; I was about to spring my trap, when I became aware that Moriarty was going to escape it-and in revenge would not only seek to destroy me, but everyone I had allied myself with. Mary was safely out of harm's way for the moment, so John and I slipped off to the Continent with Moriarty in pursuit. To make the story as brief as possible, I hoped that we could occupy him at the least, and possibly bring him to justice, and while he was concentrating on us, the police would be able to swoop in and round up his gang."</p><p>"We stayed as close to water as we could at all times," John put in at that point. "It would have been much easier if we'd had Mary along-"</p><p>"I absolutely forbade that," Holmes interrupted with a frown. "Not that I do not believe Mary perfectly capable, but it was enough of a risk bringing John in. Moriarty would have immediately made Mary his target as the weakest of the three of us; he would have used her ruthlessly against us, and in the end, brought all three of us down."</p><p>The Watsons exchanged a look. Mary shrugged, a tendril of her dark blond hair escaping from her chignon. She pushed it back behind her ear with an impatient gesture.</p><p>But Nan had a good idea of why Holmes had not wanted to risk her presence-and a good idea of why having Mary along would have been more useful than having her husband. Holmes still did not have much of an idea of what an Elemental Master could do with his or her powers. It was entirely within the realm of possibility that had Moriarty seized Mary Watson, she could have sucked the very breath out of his lungs-or rather, her Elementals could have. Under the normal course of things, no Master would ever ask her Elementals to kill, but nothing about the threat that Professor Moriarty posed could be construed as "normal."</p><p>"So we stayed close to water so we could employ the protection of my Elementals, knowing they would warn us of danger. And it was in Germany that they finally did. The Professor finally caught up with us. We chose the falls as the place with potentially the most power for me to use, and the likeliest place for Moriarty to attempt an ambush," John continued. "And as we had hoped, Moriarty took the bait as we hiked on a brief sojourn to view the falls close at hand. He sent a false message that there was a dying Englishwoman back at our inn who requested my services. We didn't fall for it, of course."</p><p>Now that they were no longer guarding their minds and memories, glimpses of what they had done in those moments flashed across Nan's mind. There was the steep, mist-soaked path leading to the falls. The roar of the falls themselves, like a roar of thunder that never ended, almost obscured the boy's speech. There was the boy; blond, bareheaded, in short leather pants, long white woolen stockings, a green wool jacket, much patched, and sturdy clogs. He wouldn't look at Watson, his eyes shifted as he gabbled out his message, and he fingered something obsessively in his right-hand pocket. The money by which Moriarty had bought him?</p><p>Holmes nodded. "John pretended to believe it, and sent the messenger back to tell them he was coming. In actuality, he only went a few hundred yards, then doubled back, warned of exactly where Moriarty was by his Elementals. Moriarty expected me to fight honorably." Holmes uttered a dry laugh. "I think, Doctor, he was rather too much a consumer of your fine stories. Watson and I got him between us; he was concentrating on me, and between the noise of the falls and his own eagerness, Watson crept up on him completely undetected. Watson, I believe you shot first?"</p><p>Again, the memory washed over her; first from Holmes' point of view. The Professor faced him, fearlessly, a cold arrogance over his features. The falls thundered at Holmes' back, and if he had not been so keyed up, he would have shivered in the cold spray. But he was keyed up; like a racehorse, waiting for the signal to spring into action. Behind Moriarty, Watson crept up the path, step by cautious, sideways step, a little crouched over, revolver in hand. In that moment she knew, with utter certainty, that Holmes had not exaggerated when he had told Watson that as long as Moriarty perished, he would be willing to die as well.</p><p>John nodded, an expression of grim satisfaction on his face. "You don't do a mad dog the courtesy of letting him have the first bite. I got him in the back. I wasn't taking a chance on missing, so I aimed for his torso. I reckoned on the shock of the first shot allowing me to get off more, even if the shot itself deflected on a rib."</p><p>Now Watson's view; and within Watson was an anxiety that was tearing him apart. He was afraid, desperately afraid, that Holmes would be honorable, be chivalrous, would offer to fight the fiend man-to-man. Watson did not intend to give Holmes the chance to make that offer-indeed, his one fear as he had doubled back was that Holmes would initiate a fair fight before he had a chance to get in place. So when he saw Holmes' gun hand twitch, ever so slightly, he did not hesitate, bur fired a burst of three shots into Moriarty's back. By the time the second had struck, Holmes had fired his own gun, reflexively.</p><p>Holmes continued. "And I shot once you had, as well. He was . . . surprised. He staggered over the side of the path and into the falls."</p><p>It was uglier than that. Moriarty staggered, gasped, bled, snarled-tried to reach for his own gun, but his right hand would not obey him, and he could not reach the pocket where it was with his left. He stumbled toward Holmes, arm outstretched, as Holmes skipped out of his grasp with great agility, despite the slippery path.</p><p>And then a half dozen long, white arms made of mist snaked out of the falls and seized him.</p><p>They were not strong, those arms, but they were enough. They pulled him off-balance, and his stumbling feet carried him to the edge of the path and over. Both John and Sherlock approached the edge of the path cautiously, lest he be somehow lurking on a ledge just beneath it, ready to seize one of them to end the victory in defeat-but there was nothing there, nothing but mist and thundering water. Moriarty was no more.</p><p>"And I made sure my Elementals pulled what was left of him down underwater and held it there for a day and a half. Between that, and after four shots and the plunge, we were sure he was finished. Holmes disappeared, and I reported his death along with that of Moriarty."</p><p>The memories let go of her, and Nan took a deep breath and a sip of her lukewarm tea. She wondered if either of them guessed what she had just witnessed.</p><p>"I stopped in a small village just long enough to telegraph you young ladies, because I did not want you to do something . . . untoward." Holmes added. "But I didn't dare do more. As it transpired, I had been too sanguine in my surety that my trap would catch all of Moriarty's gang. Much to my chagrin and alarm, I underestimated the number of his followers by fifty percent. I have been tracing and dealing with individuals for the last four weeks, and I am only halfway through what is proving to be a gargantuan task, a true Labor of Hercules."</p></p><h2>The Midnight Bell (Sean Dillon)</h2><p><b>From the <b>&#x201c;the dean of intrigue novelists&#x201d; (<i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i>)</b>&nbsp;comes a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>-bestselling novel of terrorism and revenge featuring IRA-hitman-turned-intelligence-operative Sean Dillon...</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The bell rings at midnight, as death requires it.&#x201d;</i>&#x2014;Irish proverb<br><br>In Ulster, Northern Ireland, a petty criminal kills a woman in a drunken car crash.

Now, if you would, go and get yourself a coffee while Blake and I talk.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alice withdraw and the President called, &#x201c;Join us, Colonel Hunter.&nbsp; I&#x2019;d like you to meet Blake Johnson.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hunter emerged from the Chief of Staff&#x2019;s office, a man much as Blake had expected,</p><p>around sixty, with a moustache, tanned face, an expensive suit of blue flannel.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He held out his hand briefly.&nbsp; &#x201c;Your fame precedes you, Mr. Johnson.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Colonel,&#x201d; Blake said formally.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hunter&#x2019;s smile was false and dismissive as he turned to a more important quarry. &#x201c;As I was saying earlier, Mr. President, we must present out opponents with the unexpected and seize the day.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s been one of the greatest precepts of warfare since Roman times.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President turned to Blake.&nbsp; &#x201c;Would you agree?&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;My experience of warfare was being up to my armpits in some swamp in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, so I guess I never had time to find out.&#x201d; Blake said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hunter was annoyed and let it show.&nbsp; &#x201c;We all have to move with the times,&#x201d; he said to Blake.&nbsp; &#x201c;Modern thinking, that&#x2019;s what we need. For instance, I&#x2019;m surprised that a man in your position has an elderly woman as his secretary. How computer-savvy can she be?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She could write the book on the White House,&#x201d; Blake said.&nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;s better than any computer.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And apparently has been poking her nose into Langley&#x2019;s business illegally for her Department&#x2019;s purposes.&#x201d; Hunter said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That would be <i>my</i> personal security department,&#x201d; the President said.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s called the Basement. Blake Johnson runs it, and Alice Quarmby has served every President for it, office since the Basement was first conceived.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hunter apologized hurriedly.&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course you are right, Mr. President. Still, this unauthorized accessing of CIA files &#x2014; it&#x2019;s disturbing.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You may be right, Colonel, but as I <i>am</i> the President, I&#x2019;m the one who&#x2019;ll make the decision about it.&nbsp; If you&#x2019;d show the Colonel out, Blake.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blake was at the door in a moment.&nbsp; Hunter followed, hesitated and turned.&nbsp; &#x201c;And what we discussed Mr. President &#x2014; about Havoc and the support system?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see, Colonel&#x201d;, the President said, and as Blake closed the door, added, &#x201c;Come and sit down and bring me up to date.&nbsp; Did you bring President Cazalet back?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Unfortunately, no, Mr. President.&nbsp; H said he&#x2019;s agreed to deliver a lecture at the London School of Economics about terrorism and ISIS, and he can&#x2019;t leave just yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President frowned.&nbsp; &#x201c;You did give him the envelope which contained the Presidential Warrant ordering him home again?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course.&nbsp; He said he was <i>going</i> to leave, but then Downing Street informed him that they&#x2019;d all be attending the lecture&#x2014;so he felt he had to stay. The profits, by the way, are going to charity&#x2014;the Children of Syria.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So how can I possibly complain about that?&#x201d; the President said, then laughed reluctantly.&nbsp; &#x201c;Damn you, Jake Cazalet, you&#x2019;ve left me wrong-footed on this one.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Actually, Mr. President, if I could make a suggestion?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;By all means.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you send a message to the Cabinet Office congratulating the Prime Minister and President Cazalet on their joint efforts &#x2014; and announcing that the U.S. will match the money raised for the Children of Syria. That way, it&#x2019;s as if you&#x2019;d been a part of it the whole time.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President was smiling now.&nbsp; &#x201c;What a great idea.&nbsp; I&#x2019;ll see to it at once. With one stipulation.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What would that be, Mr. President?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You climb in that Gulfstream, return to London tonight, and don&#x2019;t show your face back here without him.&nbsp; When he&#x2019;s finished his gig, I want him back, and no arguments, even if he is a billionaire.&nbsp; Let&#x2019;s have a drink on it.&#x201d;&nbsp; The President was smiling as he rose, went to a cupboard and produced a bottle of Scotch and two glasses, one of which he handed to Blake.&nbsp; &#x201c;Sit down for a moment.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President settled onto a couch. &#x201c;I imagine you think I&#x2019;m crazy, being so concerned about Cazalet, but I can&#x2019;t help thinking about what happened last year.&#x201d; The President had sent General Charles Ferguson, the head of the &#x201c;Prime Minster&#x2019;s private army,&#x201d; and his people to Cazalet&#x2019;s house on Nantucket, so that Cazalet could thank them on the President&#x2019;s behalf for the success of a recent operation. But Al Qaeda assassins had been waiting for them. &#x201c;Charles Ferguson, Sean Dillon, Captain Sara Gideon, and Cazalet, himself, they could all have died.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, they didn&#x2019;t&#x201d; Blake said. &#x201c;None of it&#x2019;s your fault. Besides, Sean Dillon is the most dangerous man I&#x2019;ve ever met. They picked the wrong target.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But they&#x2019;ll try again. Especially after Dillon and company shot the Al Qaeda Master behind the attack.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I agree with you there. I&#x2019;ve a feeling in my gut that Al Qaeda won&#x2019;t let us forget that,&#x201d; Blake said.&nbsp; &#x201c;Which is why we&#x2019;ve spent so much time keeping in touch across the Atlantic.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;My Basement,&#x201d; the President said. &#x201c;And the Prime Minister&#x2019;s private army.&#x201d;&nbsp; He shook his head.&nbsp; &#x201c;United by a common purpose and yet so far away from one another.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blake finished his drink and stood up.&nbsp; &#x201c;Not in the world we live in, not these days.&nbsp; I&#x2019;d better get going.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course. Take care.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blake turned.&nbsp; &#x201c;Always do, Mr. President,&#x201d; he said and left.</p><p>The President sat there, thinking of what Blake had said.&nbsp; <i>Not in the world we live in, not these days.&nbsp; </i>For a moment, he was touched by despair, but that would never do.&nbsp; There was work to be done, and he sat at the desk and started to go through his papers</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>*</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Frank Dolan, once a master sergeant in the Rangers, now Hunter&#x2019;s personal assistant and chauffeur, was waiting for the Colonel as he left the White House, an umbrella high against the pouring rain.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Everything go according to plan, Sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sergeant, some truly crazy people work in there, and that includes this President, his security guy, and the old bag working for them.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That must be her dozing in the Mercedes over there,&#x201d; Dolan said, and started to drive away.&nbsp; &#x201c;I looked him up.&nbsp; Blake Johnson, right?

It's the perfect laugh-out-loud counting companion to GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE!<br><br></p><p>Gerald the giraffe doesn't really have delusions of grandeur. He just wants to dance. But his knees are crooked and his legs are thin, and all the other animals mock him when he approaches the dance floor at the annual Jungle Dance. "Hey, look at clumsy Gerald," they sneer. "Oh, Gerald, you're so weird." Poor Gerald slinks away as the chimps cha-cha, rhinos rock 'n' roll, and warthogs waltz. But an encouraging word from an unlikely source shows this glum giraffe that those who are different "just need a different song," and soon he is prancing and sashaying and boogying to moon music (with a cricket accompanist). In the vein of <i>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</i>, Gerald's fickle "friends" quickly decide he's worthy of their attention again.<p> With this rhyming, poignant (in a cartoonish way) tale, Giles Andreae, author of <i>Rumble in the Jungle</i>, and numerous other picture books, shows insecure young readers that everyone can be wonderful, even those that march to the beat of a different cricket. The rhymes are somewhat awkward, but the bold, bright watercolors by Guy Parker-Rees will invite readers to kick up their heels and find their own internal harmony. (Ages 3 to 6) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Gerald the giraffe longs to dance, but his legs are too skinny and his neck is too long. His knees buckle whenever he tries to twirl. At the Jungle Dance, the warthogs waltz, the chimps cha-cha, and the lions tango. "Giraffes can't dance", they all jeer when it's Gerald's turn to prance.<p>Fortunately, there is one little creature who believes in Gerald. "Everything makes music", says the cricket, "if you really want it to". So Gerald starts swaying to his own sweet tune.</p><p>With light-footed rhymes and high-stepping illustrations, this tale is gentle inspiration for every child with dreams of greatness.</p></p><h2>Black Fox of Lorne</h2><p>Set in 1005 AD, twins Brus and Jan go a-Viking with their father Harald Redbeard and all their household.

Join Annie and her tiny taskmaster Nibbil in fun, erotic adventures sure to make you blush. This omnibus edition will include volumes one and two of Small Favors, the never-before-collected color special, behind-the-scenes materials, and a brand-new introduction.</p><p>Colleen Coover is an Eisner Award-winning comic book artist based in Portland, Oregon. Her comics include the adult title Small Favors and the all-ages Banana Sunday. She has been published by Dark Horse, Top Shelf, Marvel, and many others. She works with her husband, writer Paul Tobin, on the Eisner-winning series Bandette.PUBLISHERS WEEKLY -- Coover, cocreator of the Eisner Award-winning all-ages graphic novel <i>Bandette</i>, made her debut with a much more adult project: a sex-positive lesbian porn comic, collected here. A giggly pigtailed sprite named Nibbil is assigned to serve as the conscience to the carnally adventurous, perpetually horny Annie. Instead of keeping Annie in line, Nibbil falls in love, and the two get busy corrupting each other. Nibbil can change from a tiny pixie to a full-size woman, a power she exploits in erotic vignettes, but the fantasy angle soon moves to the background as sex and romance come to the fore. Coover's cute, cartoony black-and-white artwork, reminiscent of Archie comics or Love and Rockets, keeps the characters charming no matter how naughty their behavior or filthy their dialogue. Everyone is so perky you can't begrudge them a single orgasm. Originally published from 2000 to 2003, the cult comic is now back in a beguiling omnibus edition. It's the most lovable sex comic ever drawn. (May)<br></p><h2>Dorothy Molter: The Root Beer Lady</h2><p>Her name is synonymous with the Boundary Waters and root beer.

TEN ACROBATS adds a new chapter to the American immigrant narrative.&#x201c;What if Neil Simon wrote a lovable comedy about a Muslim-American family trying to hold itself together amidst the misunderstandings that run amuck and the comedy that ensues when the generations collide? It would probably resemble something like the surprisingly enjoyable, charming and oftentimes hilarious TEN ACROBATS IN AN AMAZING LEAP OF FAITH.&#x201d; &#x2014;Fabrizio O Almeida, New City Chicago&#x201c;With TEN ACROBATS IN AN AMAZING LEAP OF FAITH, playwright Yussef El Guindi takes the genre (of the immigrant experience) to a new place &#x2014; the Arab-American experience post September 11, 2001. With humor, passion and a lovely touch of whimsy, he's created a theatrical experience that's not to be missed.&#x201d; &#x2014;Louis Weisberg, Chicago Free Press&#x201c;El Guindi&#x2019;s engrossing play ... finds a workable balance between sharp humor and head-banging angst, which shapes his story effectively.&#x201d; &#x2014;Mary Houlihan, Chicago Sun-Times&#x201c;Woven into this complicated family drama are scenes of delightful humor. Humanity is the substance that ties not only all of the characters together but also binds the audience to them. This play beautifully serves the purposes of drama, comedy, the artistic theatrical process and, perhaps most importantly, demystifying the hate that comes from fear of unknown cultures.&#x201d; &#x2014;Venus Zarris, Gay Chicago Magazine&#x201c;The drama comes from an emotionally vivid story that captures a world of anger, joy, love and frustration as it plays out in a Muslim-American family. The appeal lies in El Guindi's ability to transcend ethnicity while still writing a rich depiction of a Muslim family ... The emotional difficulties could belong to any family of any (or no) religion ... Smart, challenging, poignant, whimsical and at times, delightfully silly.&#x201d; &#x2014;Catey Sullivan, Pioneer Press</p><p></p><h2>Day Hiking: Central Cascades</h2><p><p></p><ul><li>125 trails, each rated on an overall-quality scale of 1 to 5</li> <li>Full-color photo insert and overview map</li> <li>1% of sales donated to the Washington Trails Association for trail maintenance</li></ul> The Central Cascades offer some of the most accessible wilderness areas for urban Seattleites, with trails no less stunning or enjoyable than those in more remote regions. <em>Day Hiking Central Cascades</em> includes 50% more hikes than other regional guidebooks and focuses on cream-of-the-crop trails in these areas: Whidbey Island; Skykomish, Wenatchee, and Icicle River Valleys; the Entiat Mountains; the Lake Chelan area; and more.

Till, a black teenager from Chicago, was visiting family in a small town in Mississippi, when he allegedly whistled at a white woman. Three days later, his brutally beaten body was found floating in the Tallahatchie River.&nbsp;<br><br>In clear, vivid detail Chris Crowe investigates the before-and-aftermath of Till's murder, as well as the dramatic trial and speedy acquittal of his white murderers, situating both in the context of the nascent Civil Rights Movement.

Most American history books don't include Emmett Till, the black 14-year-old from Chicago who was brutally murdered while visiting relatives in the Mississippi Delta in 1954. But the gruesome, racially motivated crime and the court's failure to convict the white murderers was a powerful national catalyst for the civil rights movement. Crowe, the author of <i>Mississippi Trial</i> (2002), a YA novel about Till's story, begins this nonfiction account with the events that led to the murder: on a dare, Till allegedly flirted with a local white woman; several days later he was kidnapped by the woman's husband and other men. In accessible, succinct, and sometimes colloquial language, Crowe details what happened on the horrible night, the court proceedings, and how the nation responded-- the "aftershocks" of the unbelievable ruling. Crowe is particularly successful in placing the murder within its larger historical context, detailing life both in the segregated Jim Crow South and in Emmett's less volatile but still segregated Chicago, and he doesn't shy away from the horrifying details (there's a shocking black-and-white photo of Emmett's disfigured corpse among the illustrations). Crowe's occasional re-creations of events are vivid, but like the rest of the text, they would have been better served with more extensive source notes; only a few in-text references and a concluding bibliography are provided. But Crowe's powerful, terrifying account does justice to its subject in bold, direct telling, supported by numerous archival photos and quotes from those who remember, including Emmett's mother, who wrote on her son's gravestone: "A little nobody who shook up the world."

Unfortunately, post-Enlightenment theology has tended to divorce "doctrine" from "living unto God." And to the degree that this split has been deepened and perpetuated, both theology and spirituality have been impoverished. <em>Spiritual Theology</em> is a rare book. In it, Simon Chan surveys the little-explored landscape where systematic theology and godly praxis meet, highlighting the connections between Christian doctrine and Christian living and drawing out the spiritual implications of particular aspects of systematic theology. Allowing rational formulations to drop into the background, he brings the mystery of the faith to the fore. Chan begins with the principal doctrines of God, sin, salvation and the church. He then progresses to a reflective consideration of the practice of the spiritual life, from prayer to spiritual direction. Unabashedly evangelical and truly ecumenical, Chan grounds his exploration in the sources of the Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox traditions. His work is well abreast of contemporary theological currents and crossculturally conversant from an Asian perspective. <em>Spiritual Theology</em> is a book for those who care deeply about theology <em>and</em> spirituality, and strive to integrate the two. It is well worth careful reflection and prayerful reading.</p><p>Simon Chan (Ph.D., Cambridge) is Earnest Lau Professor of Systematic Theology at Trinity Theological College in Singapore. He is the author of <em>Man and Sin, Pentecostal Theology and the Christian Spiritual Tradition, Spiritual Theology: A Systematic Study of the Christian Life</em> and <em>Liturgical Theology: The Church as Worshiping Community.</em> He is also the associate editor of the <em>Global Dictionary of Theology</em> and the <em>Dictionary of Mission Theology.</em></p><h2>The Man in the Rockefeller Suit: The Astonishing Rise and Spectacular Fall of a Serial Impostor</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Forget fiction.

The police and FBI were baffled. Tips poured in, but every lead was a dead end ... because &#x201c;Clark Rockefeller&#x201d; did not exist. In a gripping work of investigative journalism, Mark Seal reveals how German native Christian Gerhartsreiter came to the United States, where he stepped in and out of identities for decades, eventually posing as a Rockefeller for twelve years, married to a wealthy woman who had no idea who he really was.

He was Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, a forty-seven-year-old German immigrant who had come to America as a student in 1978. Shortly after his arrival, he disappeared into what the Boston district attorney would call &#x201c;the longest con I've seen in my professional career.&#x201d; The elaborate, labyrinthine nature of Gerhartsreiter's shapeshifting adventures, from the time he set foot in this country as a seventeen-year-old student right up to his disappearance, makes his story more bizarre than any gifted writer of fiction could possibly invent.</p><h2>The Opposite of Hate: A Field Guide to Repairing Our Humanity</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Brilliantly&nbsp;illustrates the immense and disarming power of changing course and driving not&nbsp;toward division, but&nbsp;toward civility and mutual respect.&#x201d; &nbsp;--<i>Ms</i>. magazine</b>&nbsp;As&nbsp;a progressive commentator on Fox News and now CNN, Sally Kohn has made a career&nbsp;out of bridging&nbsp;intractable political differences.

When I&#x2019;d known him thirty years and forty pounds ago, he&#x2019;d had a full head of red-gold hair, but I could still see something of him around the eyes and mouth.<br> &#x201c;All of him.&#x201d; He patted his abdomen. &#x201c;You look good, Tori, I&#x2019;ll give you that. You didn&#x2019;t turn into some yoga nut or a vegan or something?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Nope. I play a little basketball, but mostly I run the lakefront. You still playing baseball?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;With this body? Slow-pitch sometimes with the geriatric league. But my boy, Frankie Junior, Tori, I got my fingers crossed, but I think he&#x2019;s the real deal.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;How old is he?&#x201d; I asked, more out of politeness than interest: Frank always thought someone or something was going to be the real deal that made his fortune for him.<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s fifteen now, made varsity at Saint Eloy&#x2019;s, even though he&#x2019;s only a freshman. He&#x2019;s got a real arm. Maybe he&#x2019;ll be another Boom-Boom.&#x201d;<br> Meaning, he could be the next person to make it out of the &#x2019;hood into some version of the American dream. There were so few of us who escaped South Chicago&#x2019;s gravitational pull that the neighborhood could recite our names.<br> I&#x2019;d managed, by dint of my mother&#x2019;s wishes, and my scholarships to the University of Chicago. My cousin Boom-Boom had done it through sports. He&#x2019;d had seven brilliant seasons with the Blackhawks until he injured his ankle too badly for the surgeons to glue him back in any shape to skate. And then he&#x2019;d been murdered, shoved off a pier in the Port of Chicago, right under the screw of the Bertha Krupnik.<br> When Boom-Boom and Frank hung out together, Frank hoped he&#x2019;d be a real deal, too, in baseball. We all did&#x2014;he was the best shortstop in the city&#x2019;s Catholic league. By the time I started law school, though, Frank was driving a truck for Bagby Haulage. I don&#x2019;t know what happened; I&#x2019;d lost touch with him by then.<br><br> Maybe he could have been a contender. He wasn&#x2019;t the only kid in South Chicago with a spark of promise that flared up and died. They start to spread their wings and then they fall to earth. It&#x2019;s hard to leave the world you know. Even if it&#x2019;s a painful place at times, you grow up learning how to navigate it. The world north of Madison Street looks good on TV, but it has too many hidden traps, places where a homey can make a humiliating mistake.<br> Perhaps Frankie Junior would have the drive, the mentors and the talent to be another Boom-Boom. All I said was I hoped Frank was right, it would be great. &#x201c;You stayed in South Chicago?&#x201d; I added.<br> &#x201c;We moved to the East Side. My wife&#x2014;uh, Bet&#x2014;uh,&#x201d; he stumbled over the words, his face turning a richer shade of brick.<br> Frank had left me for Betty Pokorny when we were all in high school. Her father had owned Day &amp; Night Bar &amp; Grill. When the mills were running three shifts, no matter what time you got off or went on, you could get steak and eggs with a boilermaker.<br> When Betty started smirking at me in the high school hallway, I&#x2019;d been heartbroken for a few weeks, but my dad told me that Frank wasn&#x2019;t right for me, that I was looking for love in all the wrong places because Gabriella had died a few months earlier. He&#x2019;d been right: it had been years since I&#x2019;d thought about either Frank or Betty.<br> Looking at Frank this morning, in his ill-fitting jacket and uneasy fidgeting, he seemed vulnerable and needy. Let him imagine that hearing about Betty could cause me a pang or two.<br> &#x201c;How are Betty&#x2019;s folks?&#x201d; I asked.<br> &#x201c;Her ma passed a few years back, but her dad is still going strong, even without the bar&#x2014;you know they had to shut that down?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Someone told me,&#x201d; I said. Day &amp; Night had followed the mills into extinction, but by then I was so far removed from the neighborhood that I hadn&#x2019;t even felt Schadenfreude, only a vague pity for Frank.<br> &#x201c;Her dad, he keeps busy, he&#x2019;s handy with tools, builds stuff, keeps the house from falling over. I guess you don&#x2019;t know we moved in with him when, well, you know.&#x201d;<br> When they got married, I guessed. Or maybe when Stella went to prison. &#x201c;What did you do about your place on Buffalo?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Ma kept it. My dad&#x2019;s insurance or something let her make the payments while she was in Logan. I looked in on it once a week, made sure nothing was leaking or burning, kept the rats and the gangbangers from moving in. Ma says she owns it clear and free now.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s out?&#x201d; I blurted.<br> &#x201c;Yeah. Two months ago.&#x201d; His heavy shoulders sagged, further stressing the shoulders in the jacket.<br> Annie Guzzo had been three years younger than me and I was finishing my junior year of college when she died. I counted in my head. I guess it had been twenty-five years.<br> South Chicago was a neighborhood where violence was routine, ordinary. Stella Guzzo had grown up in a hardscrabble house herself and shouting and hitting were her main modes of functioning. We all knew she hit her daughter, but what turned people&#x2019;s stomachs was that Stella had beaten Annie to death and then walked up to St. Eloy&#x2019;s to play bingo. Not even my aunt Marie, Stella&#x2019;s chief crony, stood up for her.<br> &#x201c;I never made those marks on my girl,&#x201d; Stella protested at the trial. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re lying about me, making me look bad because I was trying to get Annie to see the facts of life. She was getting those big ideas, way above herself. She didn&#x2019;t think she needed to vacuum or do the laundry because she was going to school, but she needed to remember she was part of a family. Everyone has to carry their weight in a family. She&#x2019;s got a brother, he&#x2019;s the one with a future and he needs looking after, I can&#x2019;t do it all on my own, especially not with their father dead. But Annie was fine when I left the house.&#x201d;<br> Father Gielczowski, the priest at St. Eloy&#x2019;s, had testified for Stella: she was a good woman, a dedicated mother. She didn&#x2019;t spare the rod, but that was what made her a good mother; she didn&#x2019;t tolerate the rudeness a lot of modern women let their children get away with.<br> Priests usually play well with Chicago juries, but not this time. Stella was built on massive lines, not fat, but big, like the figurehead of a Viking ship. Frank took after her, but Annie was small, like their father. The state&#x2019;s attorney showed pictures of Annie&#x2019;s battered face, and the family photos where she looked like a dark little elf next to her mother&#x2019;s broad-shouldered five-ten.<br> Instead of manslaughter, the state went for second-degree homicide, and got it. I didn&#x2019;t remember the trial clearly, but I don&#x2019;t think the jury deliberated longer than half a day. Stella drew the full two dimes, with a little extra thrown in to punish her for her belligerent attitude in court.<br> I never would be a Stella fan, but the thought of her alone in a decrepit South Chicago bungalow was disturbing. &#x201c;Is she there by herself?&#x201d; I asked Frank. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard dealing with the outside world when you&#x2019;ve been away from it so long. Besides that, South Chicago is a war zone these days, between the Kings, and the Insane Latin Dragons and about five other big gangs.&#x201d;<br> He fiddled with a chrome paperweight on my desk. &#x201c;I told Ma it wasn&#x2019;t safe, but where else was she going to go? Betty didn&#x2019;t want her living with us. It didn&#x2019;t seem right, turning my own mother away after all she&#x2019;s been through, but, you know, she&#x2019;s not the easiest person to have around. Ma said she knew when she wasn&#x2019;t wanted. Besides, she insisted on returning to the old place. It&#x2019;s hers, she says, it&#x2019;s what she knows.<br> &#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t care that the neighborhood&#x2019;s shot to heck. Or she cares but all her old pals, they&#x2019;ve moved further south, or they&#x2019;re in assisted living. Either way, she doesn&#x2019;t want to be near them. Thinks they&#x2019;ll always be talking about her behind her back.&#x201d;<br> Frank dropped the paperweight. It bounced onto the floor where it dented one of the boards. We watched it roll under my worktable.<br> &#x201c;That isn&#x2019;t why you came up here today, is it, Frank?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not imagining I&#x2019;ll baby-sit Stella, I hope.&#x201d;<br> He picked up a stapler and started opening it and snapping it shut. Staples began falling onto the desktop and floor. I took it from him and set it down, out of his reach.<br> &#x201c;What is it, Frank?&#x201d;<br> He walked to the door, not trying to leave, just trying to pull words together. He walked around in a circle and came back.<br> &#x201c;Tori, don&#x2019;t get mad, but Ma thinks&#x2014;Ma says&#x2014;she thinks&#x2014;she says&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> I waited while he fumbled for words.<br> &#x201c;Ma is sure she was framed.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, that doesn&#x2019;t surprise me.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You know she was?&#x201d; His face lightened.<br> &#x201c;No, Frank. But I believe she wants to rewrite the story of her life. She always set herself up as the most moral, pious woman in South Chicago, then she does time, can&#x2019;t face the women she used to look down on. Of course she has to change the past so she&#x2019;s the martyr, not the villain.&#x201d;<br> He pounded his thighs in frustration. &#x201c;She could have been framed, it could have happened. I never believed she would have hit Annie hard enough to hurt her.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I am not going to spend time and energy trying to prove your mother&#x2019;s innocence.&#x201d; My mouth set in a tight line.<br> &#x201c;Did I ask you to do that? Did I? That isn&#x2019;t what I want.&#x201d; He sucked in a deep breath. &#x201c;She can&#x2019;t afford a lawyer, a real lawyer, I mean, not a public defender, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And you thought of me?&#x201d; I was so angry I jumped to my feet. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what the gossip about me is in South Chicago, but I did not become Bill Gates when I moved away. And even if I did, why would I help your mother? She always thought Gabriella was some kind of whore, that she cast a spell over your dad and then stole Annie. Stella liked to say I was a bad apple falling close to a rotten tree, or words to that effect.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2014;I know she said all that stuff. I&#x2019;m not asking you to be her lawyer. But you could ask questions, you&#x2019;re a detective, and people know you, they&#x2019;d trust you the way they wouldn&#x2019;t trust a cop.&#x201d;<br> By now his face was so scarlet that I feared he&#x2019;d have a stroke on the spot.<br> &#x201c;Even if I wanted to do this, which I don&#x2019;t, I don&#x2019;t know the neighborhood anymore. I&#x2019;ve been away as long as Stella has. Longer.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You were just back there,&#x201d; he objected. &#x201c;I heard about it at Sliga&#x2019;s, that you&#x2019;d been to the high school and everything.&#x201d;<br> I shouldn&#x2019;t have been surprised. South Chicago and the East Side are like a small town. You sneeze on Ninetieth Street, they whip out a handkerchief on Escanaba Avenue.<br> Over the weekend, I&#x2019;d taken Bernadine Fouchard, Boom-Boom&#x2019;s goddaughter, on a tour of my cousin&#x2019;s old haunts. I showed her the place near Dead Stick Pond where he practiced skating in the winter, and where I&#x2019;d help him hunt for the puck when it went into the nearby marsh grasses. We&#x2019;d gone to the breakwater in Calumet Harbor where Boom-Boom and I used to dare the freighters by jumping in to swim. I&#x2019;d taken her to the public high school where I played on the state champion basketball team, picked up tacos at Estella&#x2019;s on Commercial Avenue. We hadn&#x2019;t gone to Sliga&#x2019;s bar, but probably someone at the high school mentioned it over a boilermaker.<br> &#x201c;I went as a tourist, Frank. I can&#x2019;t help your mother.&#x201d;<br> He came over to me, gripping my arms. &#x201c;Tori, please. She went to, well, to a lawyer, who told her there wasn&#x2019;t any evidence.&#x201d;<br> I pulled away. &#x201c;Of course there isn&#x2019;t. If she&#x2019;d had any evidence when Annie died, she could have used it at her trial.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Tori, come on, you know what it&#x2019;s like, you go to court, it&#x2019;s all confusing, she never pled guilty but the lawyer, he was inexperienced, he didn&#x2019;t know how to run the case.&#x201d;<br> Frank was right: a trial is bewildering for inexperienced defendants. I didn&#x2019;t like Stella, but I could imagine how unbalanced she must have felt. She&#x2019;d never been to court, not even to fight a traffic ticket. She wouldn&#x2019;t have known the first thing about how evidence is presented, how everything you say on the stand, or before you ever get to trial, is taken apart and put together again in a way you&#x2019;d never recognize.<br> &#x201c;Even so, I am not wasting time and energy on problems Stella brought on herself.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you let go of that old grudge? Ma&#x2019;s had a hard life. Dad died in the mill, she had to fight the company for his workers&#x2019; comp, then Annie died&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Frank, listen to yourself. She murdered Annie. And she had to fight the company for the comp claim because she started spreading rumors that your father committed suicide. Don&#x2019;t you remember what Stella did at Gabriella&#x2019;s funeral? She marched in on the middle of the service and dragged Annie out, yelling that Gabriella was a whore. I do not feel sorry for your mother. I will never feel sorry for your mother.&#x201d;<br> Frank grabbed my hands. &#x201c;Tori, that&#x2019;s why I thought&#x2014;hoped&#x2014;don&#x2019;t you remember, that was the night&#x2014;Annie was that upset, I never saw her like that, when Ma dragged her home&#x2014;if someone told me Ma or Annie, one would kill the other, I would have thought Annie for sure, after your ma&#x2019;s funeral. But I&#x2014;don&#x2019;t you remember?&#x201d;<br> My mother&#x2019;s funeral was a blur in my mind. My father and I, uncomfortable in our dress-up clothes. The pallbearers&#x2014;my uncle Bernie; Bobby Mallory, my dad&#x2019;s closest friend on the force; other cops, all in their dress uniforms; a police chaplain, since my unreligious mother hadn&#x2019;t known a rabbi. Gabriella had been a wisp by the time she died; her coffin couldn&#x2019;t have taken six big men to lift it.<br> Mr. Fortieri, my mother&#x2019;s vocal coach, fought back tears, twisting a silk handkerchief over and over, but Eileen Mallory wept openly. I could feel the tightness again in my throat&#x2014;I had vowed I wouldn&#x2019;t cry, not in front of my aunt Marie. Annie Guzzo&#x2019;s sobs had angered me. What right had she to cry for Gabriella?<br> And then Stella roared in, beside herself. Mouth flecked white with spit, or was that a detail I was adding? At home that night I&#x2019;d sat alone in the dark in my attic room, staring at the street, unable to move, leaving my dad to deal with his drunk sister Elena and the stream of neighbors, of cops, of my mother&#x2019;s piano and voice students. And then&#x2014;<br> Frank had appeared at the top of the steep flight of stairs, come to say how sorry he was, for my loss, for his mother&#x2019;s behavior. In the dark, sick with loss, tired of the adult world on the ground floor, I&#x2019;d found a comfort in his embrace. Our teenage fumblings with clothes and bodies, neither of us knowing what we were doing, somehow that got me through the first hard weeks of Gabriella&#x2019;s death.<br> I squeezed Frank&#x2019;s fingers and gently removed my hands. &#x201c;I remember. You were very kind.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;So will you do this, Tori? Will yo...</p><h2>The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism: Its Fundamentals and History</h2><p>Written by a great modern Nyingma master, Dudjom Rinpoche's <i>The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism</i> covers in detail and depth both the fundamental teachings and the history of Tibetan Buddhism's oldest school. This, the first English translation of His Holiness' masterwork, constitutes the most complete work of its type in the West.<br><br>An absolute treasure for students of the tradition, it is also an indispensable reference for anyone with an interest in Buddhism. The book includes chronologies and glossaries that elucidate Buddhist doctrine, and it provides fascinating insights into the Buddhist history of Tibet. Two treatises form the present volume, namely the <i>Fundamentals of the Nyingma School</i> and the <i>History of the Nyingma School</i>. Among the most widely read of all His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche's works, these treatises were composed during the years immediately following his arrival in India as a refugee. His intention in writing them was to preserve the precise structure of the Nyingma philosophical view within its own historical and cultural context.<br><br>This is the first time this text has been available in a trade edition. Beautifully presented, this single-volume edition represents a truly wonderful gift, and features illustrations in black and white and in color, plus maps, bibliographic information, and useful annotations.</p><p>Matthew Kapstein is Numata Professor of Buddhist Studies at the University of Chicago. His previous publications include the <i>Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhism: Conversion, Contestation, and Memory</i> and, with the anthropologist Melvyn C. Goldstein, <i>Buddhism in Contemporary Tibet: Religious Revival and Cultural Identity</i>. He is co-translator of the late H.H. Dujom Rinpoche's <i>The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism</i>. Since 2002 he has also served as director of Tibetan Studies at the ecole Pratique des Hautes etudes, Paris.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Tibetan</p><h2>Everyone Worth Knowing</h2><p>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A GIRL ON THE FRINGE ENTERS THE REALM OF NEW YORK'S CHIC, PARTY-HOPPING ELITE? <br><br> Soon after Bette Robinson quits her horrendous Manhattan banking job like the impulsive girl she's never been, the novelty of walking her four-pound dog around her unglamorous Murray Hill neighborhood wears as thin as the "What are you going to do with your life?" phone calls from her parents. Then Bette meets Kelly, head of Manhattan's hottest PR firm, and suddenly she has a brand-new job where the primary requirement is to see and be seen inside the VIP rooms of the city's most exclusive nightclubs. But when Bette begins appearing in a vicious new gossip column, she realizes that the line between her personal and professional life is...invisible.</p><p>Lauren Weisberger, whose bestselling debut <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i> outed the vicious antics of the magazine industry elite, is back at it with <i>Everyone Worth Knowing</i>, another cautionary tale of sex, power, and fame. This time around, the PR industry is her target, and <i>Prada</i> fans will recognize similar themes throughout this entertaining, if at times overly dramatic, expos�.<p> Bette Robinson is a twentysomething Emory graduate who shunned her parents' hippie ideals in favor of a high-paying yet excruciatingly boring job at a prestigious investment bank. One day, after a particularly condescending exchange with her boss (who sends her daily inspirational e-mails), Bette walks out on her job in a huff. After a few weeks of sleeping late, watching Dr. Phil and entertaining her dog Millington, Bette's uncle scores her a job at an up-and-coming public relations firm, where her entire job seems to revolve around staying out late partying and providing fodder for clandestine gossip columns. What follows is one episode after another of Bette climbing up the social ladder at the expense of her friends, family, and the one guy who actually seems worth pursuing. </p><p> Weisberger is clever enough to turn seemingly outrageous circumstances into amusing anecdotes, like the tale of a woman who was close to suicide until she found out she was only 18 months away from scoring a highly coveted Birkin bag ("You simply cannot kill yourself when you're that close ... it's just not an option."). This wit, combined a hint of voyeurism that most of us can't deny, is what makes <i>Everyone Worth Knowing</i> a guilty pleasure that's well worth the indulgence. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i><br> </p> <p> <strong>The Significant Seven with Lauren Weisberger</strong><br><i>Lauren graciously agreed to answer the questions we like to ask every author.</i><br><br><b>Q:</b> What book has had the most significant impact on your life?<br><b>A:</b> Very tough question. For the first half of my life, it would definitely have to be <i>Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret</i> by Judy Blume. I worshipped that book. Recently, I'd say that it was <i>Empire Falls</i> by Richard Russo. Even though there's not a tremendous amount of action, the characters are brilliant. It's a hauntingly realistic depiction of small-town America. And the place descriptions are so compelling that the book is compulsively page-turning.<br><br><b>Q:</b> You are stranded on a desert island with only one book, one CD, and one DVD--what are they?<br><b>A:</b> This is not the time for self-improvement, that's for sure--they'd all have to be 100% entertainment. For book it would have to be <i>The Last of the California Girls</i>, a random novel that I've read 2,000 times; for CD I would say <i>Monster Ballads</i>, the album of cheesy 80's love songs that I ordered from an 800-number, and for DVD, it would be <i>Dirty Dancing</i>, of course. <br><br><b>Q:</b> What is the worst lie you've ever told?<br><b>A:</b> That one's easy. It goes something like this: "Hi, (insert editor's name here)! Yes, of course, it's already finished. I'm just tweaking a few sentences, and I'll have the whole draft to you by Monday, latest."<br><br><b>Q:</b> Describe the perfect writing environment.<br><b>A:</b> For me, the best writing environments are all about deprivation and the removal of temptation. Therefore, anywhere on earth where there's no TV, no phone, no internet access, no friends, and no fridge is pretty much perfect. <br><br><b>Q:</b> If you could write your own epitaph, what would it say?<br><b>A:</b> I really don't want to think about this one, but if I HAVE to, I hope it would include a few keywords like "brilliant," "supremely talented," and "drop-dead gorgeous." <br><br><b>Q:</b> Who is the one person living or dead that you would like to have dinner with?<br><b>A:</b> I'm supposed to say Hemingway or Moses or Madonna, right? It'd probably just be my sister, Dana. We already have a lot of dinners together, so I know it's a guaranteed good laugh.<br><br><b>Q:</b> If you could have one superpower, what would it be?<br><b>A:</b> The ability to be invisible!

The book opens flat on the bench and is easy to use! The larger 8-1/2 x 11 page size is an improvement, too. The author has received favorable comments from repairers all over the country who have been rescued from difficult chime clock repair problems. They turned to the chapter on their clock and followed each illustrated step in the disassembly, repair, assembly and adjustment. Eighteen chime movements are covered, including Seth Thomas No. 124, 113, and Sonora Chime; New Haven; Sessions; Hermle; Ansonia; Winterhalder; Urgos; Jauch; Mauthe; Junghans; and more. The two lead-off chapters, Chime Basics and Common Repair Problems, are also indispensable. The novice clock repairer can move on to repair the clocks covered in the book; these are the clocks people actually have, not rare museum pieces. The professional will want to keep the book handy to use as a reference each time one of the movements comes in for repair and that&#39;s often! The detailed drawings in this 126-page book are the author&#39;s trademark. Chime Clock Repair has a table of contents and index.</p><p>Steven G. Conover writes books on clock repair and clockmaking. His eleven titles include Clock Repair Basics, a beginning book; Chime Clock Repair, a text covering the most common chime clocks seen by repairers; Building an American Clock Movement, which illustrates how to make a complete timepiece movement; and Repairing French Pendulum Clocks, covering several types of French clocks. As editor of Clockmakers Newsletter, Steven published an eight-page subscription newsletter featuring clock repair articles, repair tips, questions &amp; answers, and product reviews, from 1987 through 2008. He is working on a new Workshop Series version of Clockmakers Newsletter. The series presents the edited, updated content of the newsletters, reorganized by topic, in book form.

But health care is only one of many factors that determine the extent to which people live healthy lives, and fairness is not the only consideration in determining whether a health policy is just. In this pathbreaking book, senior bioethicists Powers and Faden confront foundational issues about health and justice.<br></p><p><br><strong>Madison Powers</strong> is Professor of Philosophy and Senior Research Scholar, Kennedy Institute of Ethics, Georgetown University.<br><br><strong>Ruth Faden</strong> is Wagley Professor of Biomedical Ethics, and Director, Berman Bioethics Institute, Johns Hopkins University.<br><br>"Powers and Faden have given us a powerful and lucid theory that gives us the tools to unify our work in such disparate areas as bioethics, public health, global justice, and human rights. All of us who work in this area are in their debt.--John D. Arras, Porterfield Professor of Biomedical Ethics, University of Virginia<p></p><br>"Most moral theorists think about what principles of justice would govern an ideal world. Such ideal theories do not necessarily guide us well in our non-ideal world. Powers and Faden make a powerful case for moving from ideal to non-ideal theory, and ably show how to do it in the field of justice in health care. This book makes an important advance in making moral theory more empirically responsible."--Elizabeth Anderson, John Rawls Collegiate Professor of Philosophy and Women's Studies, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor<p></p><br>"Faden and Powers have produced a compelling and important argument regarding what social justice requires of states and the various social institutions they facilitate. One can only hope that their articulation of this very good constitutional idea--that as a very fundamental, constitutional matter states ought to promote social justice and that what that means is that states must provide for human well-being along those six crucial dimensions--will receive a wide readership, not only by public health professionals or the lay public, but also by constitutional lawyers and theorists."--Robin L. West, <em>DePaul Journal of Health Care Law</em>, Frederick J. Haas Chair in Law and Philosophy, Georgetown Law Center<p></p><br>"<em>Social Justice</em> is one of the most important books to come out in bioethics, and health policy ethics, in the last decade. It challenges us to think more broadly about what bioethics brings to the table when we evaluate health policies and public health practices. Its combination of rigor and clarity is uncommon."--Peter A. Ubel, M.D., Director, Center for Behavioral and Decision Sciences in Medicine, Ann Arbor<p></p><br>"Powers and Faden articulate a distinct theory of social justice emphasizing a threshold of sufficiency in six different dimensions of well-being. Their original, robust, well defended theory, combined with their subsequent application of the theory to a sensibly chosen set of health policy issues, make <em>Social Justice</em>...an unmistakably prominent book in the field."--Paul T. Menzel, Professor of Philosophy, Pacific Lutheran University<p></p><br>"In this excellent book, Madison Powers and Ruth Faden set out to define the essential dimensions of well-being that should guide a theory of justice, and then to show how such a theory can be applied to important issues in public health and health policy."--Hastings Center Report<p></p><br>"With Social Justice: The Moral Foundations of Public Health and Health Policy, the multidisciplinary writers' team of Madison Powers and Ruth Faden have delivered an interesting and compelling answer to the questions of how much inequality in health a just society can tolerate and which inequalities matter most." <br>--Metapsychology <br><p></p><br></p><h2>The End of Time: The Next Revolution in Physics</h2><p>Richard Feynman once quipped that "Time is what happens when nothing else does." But Julian Barbour disagrees: if nothing happened, if nothing changed, then time would stop. For time is nothing but change. It is change that we perceive occurring all around us, not time. Put simply, time does not exist.<br> In this highly provocative volume, Barbour presents the basic evidence for a timeless universe, and shows why we still experience the world as intensely temporal. It is a book that strikes at the heart of modern physics. It casts doubt on Einstein's greatest contribution, the spacetime continuum, but also points to the solution of one of the great paradoxes of modern science, the chasm between classical and quantum physics. Indeed, Barbour argues that the holy grail of physicists--the unification of Einstein's general relativity with quantum mechanics--may well spell the end of time.<br> Barbour writes with remarkable clarity as he ranges from the ancient philosophers Heraclitus and Parmenides, through the giants of science Galileo, Newton, and Einstein, to the work of the contemporary physicists John Wheeler, Roger Penrose, and Steven Hawking. Along the way he treats us to enticing glimpses of some of the mysteries of the universe, and presents intriguing ideas about multiple worlds, time travel, immortality, and, above all, the illusion of motion.<br> <em>The End of Time</em> is a vibrantly written and revolutionary book. It turns our understanding of reality inside-out.<br></p><p><br><strong>Julian Barbour</strong> is a theoretical physicist who has worked on foundational issues in physics and astronomy for 35 years. His first book, the widely praised <em>The Discovery of Dynamics</em>, has recently been republished in paperback. In 2000 the Association of American Publishers awarded <em>The End of Time</em> its prestigious award for excellence in the Physics &amp; Astronomy section. <strong>Julian Barbour</strong>, a theoretical physicist, has worked on foundational issues in physics for 35 years. He is the author of the widely praised <em>Absolute or Relative Motion?: Volume I</em>, and is working on the second volume.<br>"This book presents a number of subtle physical (and accompanying philosophical) ideas in a non-technical manner for the non-professional reader. The exposition is often a model of clarity..., presenting very difficult physical and conceptual ideas in a remarkably lucid way."--Mathematical<br>Reviews<br><br>"This book is gold.... Barbour leaves his mark on every topic he considers, including the arrow of time and the origins of the Big Bang. One is left with a remarkable conception of reality and a sense of a personal quest.... Above all we get a sense of what economy of thought can truly be, of<br>how shocking and sparse the concepts of physics may turn out to be.... Whether or not Barbour is right in his vision, as pedagogy and as analysis his book is a masterpiece."--The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"An unusual alternate to the standard way of viewing the four-dimensional universe (three spatial dimensions and time), beginning with how our perception of time is formed."--Publishers Weekly<br><br>"Barbour's theories may lead to the solution of one of the great paradoxes of modern science: the chasm between classical and quantum physics."--Science News<br><br>"The End of Time [is] British physicist Julian Barbour's treatise on the idea that time doesn't even exist. It's nothing more, he says, than an illusion, a sort of cosmic parlor trick.... The orderly flow of events may really be as much an illusion as the flickering frames of a movie. And<br>according to independent physicist Barbour's new book, even the apparent sequence of the flickers is illusory."--Time<br><br>"In this provocative volume, Barbour presents the basic evidence for the nonexistence of time, explaining what a timeless universe is like and showing how the world will nonetheless be experienced as intensely temporal."--The Astronomical Society of the Pacific<br><br>"Most of the work is concerned with the struggle to resolve the disparities among classical physics, quantum mechanics, and general relativity. Barbour argues that the omission of time from the foundations of physics will enable scientists to achieve a unified theory of physics.... A book that<br>deserves serious study and consideration."--Jack W. Weigel, Library Journal<br><br>"I cannot think of another book that so successfully forces the reader to reconsider his or her most intimate assumptions about reality. But there is much more here than a radical scientific vision. In order to properly explain his destruction of time, Barbour also offers one of the clearest<br>overview explanations of twentieth century physics available. Whether he is right or wrong, Barbour is on a great intellectual journey, and he is articulate enough to allow us to observe him in flight. Of course, if Barbour is right, the previous sentence would have to be rewritten. Read the book<br>and learn how."--Jaron Lanier<br><br>"Julian Barbour is so knowledgable about contemporary physics--especially general relativity theory, quantum theory, and quantum gravity--so learned in the history of physics, so gifted at analytical philosophy and so elegant and amusing in his presentation that anyone who seriously confronts<br>his argumentation and nevertheless remains a temporalist (as I do) will inevitably emerge a stronger, subtler, and wiser advocate of that philosophy."--Abner Shimnoy, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy and Physics, Boston University<br><br>"Julian Barbour's new theory of time is the most interesting and provocative new idea about time to be proposed in many years. If true it will change the way we see reality. Experts in the field of quantum gravity have for years looked up to Julian Barbour for his wisdom and imagination, as he<br>is one of the few people who is truly both a scientist and a philosopher. Written with rare clarity and force, this book makes his thinking accessible to all interested readers."--Lee Smolin</p><h2>Applying the Science of Learning</h2><p><p> <b> <i>A concrete guide to the science of learning, instruction, and assessment written in a friendly tone and presented in a dynamic format. </i> </b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The underlying premise of <i>Applying the Science of Learning </i>is that educators can better help students learn if they understand the processes through which student learning takes place.

Growing up, I was interested in creative preparations of vegetables that were able to mask their flavor. Then a few years ago, I had a juice that changed it all for me&#x2014;a mix that&#x2019;s better than any po&#x2019; boy you&#x2019;ll ever eat.

Jung Foundation Books Series)</h2><p>An experience of the fragility of conventional images of masculinity is something many modern men share. Psychoanalyst Guy Corneau traces this experience to an even deeper feeling men have of their fathers' silence or absence&#x2014;sometimes literal, but especially emotional and spiritual. Why is this feeling so profound in the lives of the postwar "baby boom" generation&#x2014;men who are now approaching middle age? Because, he says, this generation marks a critical phase in the loss of the masculine initiation rituals that in the past ensured a boy's passage into manhood. In his engaging examination of the many different ways this missing link manifests in men's lives, Corneau shows that, for men today, regaining the essential "second birth" into manhood lies in gaining the ability to be a father to themselves&#x2014;not only as a means of healing psychological pain, but as a necessary step in the process of becoming whole.</p><p>Guy Corneau is a Jungian analyst trained at the C. G. Jung Institute in Zurich and co-founder of the Jung Circle of Montreal. He has given numerous lectures and workshops on masculine psychology.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Fear the Dark (Bishop/Special Crimes Unit)</h2><p><b>In <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Kay Hooper&#x2019;s latest Bishop/Special Crimes Unit novel, an SCU team investigates a disturbing string of disappearances...</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>How do you find someone who has vanished without a trace?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Something strange is happening in the small mountain town of Serenity, Tennessee.

She was bored with school, bored with her parents, bored with most of her friends, and had been well on the way to being bored with her boyfriend, Simon Church (of all things!), until he suggested that they just pack up and leave this very boring little town.</p><p>Amy was sensible enough even at seventeen to know that the suggestion had been prompted more by his failing grades in school and the six-pack of beer he&#x2019;d polished off that night than any seriously deep feelings for her, but she discovered that she didn&#x2019;t really care what had prompted the suggestion.</p><p>It suited her just fine.</p><p>Simon had worked construction since his midteens, and Amy was only one credit away from earning her certificate as a beautician at the nearby community college, so she was confident they could support themselves. She had her college savings (fairly pitiful, which was why beauty school) and Simon had two weeks&#x2019; pay in his pocket, and they decided that was enough to get started on.</p><p>Even after he&#x2019;d sobered up, Simon was ready to leave Serenity and take Amy with him, even to the point of being willing to go along with her plans for a mysteriously secret buildup to their departure. She didn&#x2019;t confide even in her girlfriends, because she knew all too well that one of them was bound to blab to her older brother or one of theirs, and before you could say scat everybody in town would know.</p><p>Since Simon was eighteen and had a decent car in his name&#x2014;courtesy of his parents&#x2014;all paid off and insured and everything, they decided to take that. And for nearly a week, they had a lot of fun in gradually sneaking into his car those items they felt unable to leave without. There was a brief argument about Simon&#x2019;s flat-screen, but in the end he managed to make room and Amy agreed that they&#x2019;d certainly need a TV wherever they landed.</p><p>Because that was the fun part, as far as she was concerned. No real plans. They&#x2019;d just leave, and drive, and decide somewhere along the way where to settle&#x2014;at least for a time.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll stop in Pigeon Forge or Gatlinburg,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d suggested to Simon, &#x201c;and both write postcards to our families.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then just keep going,&#x201d; he said with some relish.</p><p>Amy nodded. &#x201c;Then just keep going. We could head west, or north&#x2014;wherever.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And our parents probably won&#x2019;t even know we&#x2019;re gone until they get the postcards,&#x201d; Simon said.</p><p>Amy wasn&#x2019;t so sure about that, given her father&#x2019;s watchful eye, but she was still certain she could sneak out once her parents were in bed, and by morning she and Simon would be out of the reach of both sets of parents.</p><p>She was certain of that.</p><p>She just loved the idea that people would wake to find the two of them mysteriously vanished. She did spare a pang for the worry that would undoubtedly seize her parents but was certain a reassuring postcard in a couple of days would be enough to allay worry.</p><p>The plan was perfect. And over the course of just three days, they were somehow able to sneak their things from their respective houses and get everything in Simon&#x2019;s car without anyone the wiser. Three days, and they were ready to leave, Simon telling his parents casually that he was spending that Friday night with a friend because they&#x2019;d planned a very early fishing trip in the morning, and Amy all set to just wait until her parents were in bed to sneak out and join her boyfriend at the appointed meeting place just down the block.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t until then that it crossed her mind that Simon hadn&#x2019;t said anything at all about getting married, but she shrugged that thought off with careless ease.</p><p>It would all work out just fine, she was sure of that. And their departure would certainly give everyone something to talk about for quite a while. A mystery to brighten their dull lives.</p><p>She had no trouble sneaking out of the house, and it was just after midnight that Friday night when she slid into the passenger side of Simon&#x2019;s Jeep.</p><p>&#x201c;Ready?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Am I ever. Let&#x2019;s get out of here.&#x201d; Amy was looking forward to being, however briefly, a mystery in a town where nothing mysterious ever happened.</p><p>Even barely awake, Jonah Riggs groaned as the phone on his nightstand shrilled a demand. He was tangled in the covers as usual but managed to maneuver himself over far enough to grab the phone and shut it up.</p><p>Lying back with his eyes closed, he muttered, &#x201c;It better be good.&#x201d; He had gotten to bed somewhere near dawn after winning enormous imaginary sums at the monthly poker game the city fathers would have frowned upon&#x2014;had they not been his opponents.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t know what time it was, but his aching head and scratchy eyes said it was too damned early.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry, Chief, but there&#x2019;s something you need to see.&#x201d; Sarah Waters didn&#x2019;t sound all that sorry, but she was his lead detective, his second in command, and since she and his younger sister had played together in the sandbox, he was only mildly surprised she didn&#x2019;t offer a more colorful and less apologetic awakening.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Saturday, Sarah. My day off. My first day off in three damned weeks. Can&#x2019;t you handle it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said simply.</p><p>That woke him up, because in her whole life, he&#x2019;d never seen anything Sarah couldn&#x2019;t handle.</p><p>He fought free of the covers and sat on the edge of his bed, running his fingers through his hair. He needed a haircut. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; he asked her.</p><p>She hesitated, then said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be easier if you just come see for yourself. Honest, Jonah, I wouldn&#x2019;t call you out here if I didn&#x2019;t think it was important.&#x201d;</p><p>He knew that. &#x201c;Out where?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;North side of town, off Main and about a hundred yards down Street.&#x201d;</p><p>That was actually the name of the street. Street. Jonah had wondered more than once if they&#x2019;d just run out of names, or if somebody had been having fun and it just stuck.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there in fifteen. Oh&#x2014;Sarah? Are we talking about an actual crime?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not quite sure,&#x201d; she replied.</p><p>He found that somewhat baffling but didn&#x2019;t waste time with more questions. &#x201c;Okay, you know the drill. Keep everybody back away from whatever it is until I get there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Copy that.&#x201d;</p><p>Jonah hung up the phone, frowning, and headed for the shower, hoping enough hot water would clear his head. Because so far, this was hardly a normal Saturday morning.</p><p>It got stranger.</p><p>Jonah seldom wore a uniform, virtually always in jeans, clipping his badge to his belt near the front, wearing his gun on his right hip, and depending on the weather, either a T-shirt or sweatshirt or else a light Windbreaker over a button-up shirt.</p><p>This Saturday morning in May was cool but comfortable, the middle-of-the-night rainstorm hours past. But it was also supposed to be an off day for Jonah, so he wore a sweatshirt with the faded letters of Duke University across his chest.</p><p>He had stopped at a coffee shop in town and swallowed some aspirin, but his head didn&#x2019;t feel any better when he stopped his Jeep behind Sarah&#x2019;s cruiser and got out to join her.</p><p>She was leaning against the front of her cruiser, frowning at another Jeep, this one pulled more or less off the road, with both front doors standing open.</p><p>Jonah didn&#x2019;t see another soul about. Clearly, Sarah had decided against calling the station, for whatever reason. It wasn&#x2019;t a large police station or police force, and it was rare to see more than one officer or detective out on patrol.</p><p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that Simon Church&#x2019;s Jeep?&#x201d; he asked as he reached her.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. I checked the registration and tag to be sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So where is he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The question of the day.&#x201d; Sarah eyed him. &#x201c;You up for this?&#x201d;</p><p>He grunted. &#x201c;Depends on what this is. You gonna tell me, or shall I figure it out for myself?&#x201d;</p><p>Unsmiling, she said, &#x201c;Take a look inside the Jeep.&#x201d;</p><p>Jonah didn&#x2019;t argue, just moved forward, sticking to the paved-road side of the Jeep. He had already noted that there were no skid marks, and no sign that the vehicle had been forced off the road. No body damage he could see, and all four tires seemed fine.</p><p>He looked in the front passenger door, and a nameless dread began to crawl up his spine. The vehicle was packed with stuff. Not stuff one would expect if a robbery had been committed&#x2014;despite the flat-screen TV. Packed in tight in the back were clothes, shoes, luggage presumably holding more of the same and . . . things.</p><p>A stuffed bear sat atop a stack of books, squeezed in beside a golf bag. There was a basket holding an odd assortment of things that included a dog&#x2019;s collar and leash, a can of WD-40, a laptop and tangle of cords and cables, a case holding CDs or DVDs, and a teapot.</p><p>Shirts and dresses and sweaters still on hangers were laid across luggage probably filled with the same sort of thing. There was what looked like a little sewing kit sitting atop a tackle box. There was a cooler of the sort most people used to transport adult beverages. There was another stuffed animal, this one a puffy cat, sitting atop a goldfish bowl where one lone fish swam rather desperately around in his shallow world.</p><p>Still bent forward and still without touching the car, Jonah turned his gaze to the front seat. Not much on the driver&#x2019;s side. A little open change niche filled with coins and gum wrappers and at least two petrified French fries.</p><p>On the passenger seat, very neatly in the center, sat a purse decorated all over with beads and fake gems. It was very colorful.</p><p>Jonah straightened and looked back at Sarah. &#x201c;You checked the purse?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Amy Grimes. Her driver&#x2019;s license is in a wallet that contains, I&#x2019;m guessing, a few thousand dollars. I didn&#x2019;t want to disturb anything even with gloves, until you saw it all.&#x201d;</p><p>Jonah frowned at the Jeep another moment, then returned his gaze to Sarah. &#x201c;All the earmarks of an elopement.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s what I thought.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, they didn&#x2019;t get very far, that&#x2019;s one thing. I&#x2019;m guessing Amy sneaked out of her house sometime after midnight; even at a crawl, they should have reached the highway before dawn.&#x201d;</p><p>Jonah glanced back toward town and silently agreed with her. Hell, even if they&#x2019;d left at dawn, they should have gotten farther.</p><p>&#x201c;Gas? They broke down?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Key&#x2019;s in the ignition, as you see. I cranked it up. Tank&#x2019;s full, and the engine seemed to be running fine.&#x201d;</p><p>Jonah looked over the inside once again, then walked back along the Jeep until he reached the bumper. He lifted his brows at his lead detective. &#x201c;Both doors found open.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t a question. &#x201c;Pulled mostly off the road. A purse with money. Valuables in the back. And the key in the ignition, making it easy for somebody to steal the whole shebang.&#x201d;</p><p>Sarah nodded. &#x201c;Now we come to the very weird part.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now we come to it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; She stepped over onto the grassy verge and led the way just as far as the open driver&#x2019;s-side door. &#x201c;Look down there.&#x201d;</p><p>There was no guardrail here, and the bank on the side of the road sloped gradually down to a flat area; from that, a vague path led toward a stand of trees while another vague path led off to the left, toward a distant creek. Neither of the paths was well traveled, just handy shortcuts, mostly for kids.</p><p>But right now both the bank and the flat area were more dirt than grass. Mud, since the rainstorm hours before.</p><p>Very clearly, two sets of footprints were visible going down the bank and to the flat area. One larger set, probably boots; one much smaller set, undoubtedly a woman or girl.</p><p>The prints were absolutely perfect, showing no slipping or sliding. The bootprints and shoeprints were side by side down the bank, to the flat. Where they stopped.</p><p>Where they just . . . stopped.</p><p>That wordless dread was growing in Jonah. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been down there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. I stayed away from the prints, circled. There&#x2019;s nothing, Jonah. And there should be. All around the place where the prints stop, there would have been prints if they&#x2019;d gone on. There&#x2019;s no way they could have jumped far enough, and no sign at all they did. No sign of a vehicle, no sign of a horse. No sign of a third person. I&#x2019;d dare anybody to back up that bank, putting their feet in exactly the same spots as when they went down; it&#x2019;s slippery as hell and there&#x2019;s nothing to hold on to.&#x201d; She drew a breath and let it out slowly. &#x201c;If this is a prank, it&#x2019;s a damned good one. But I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a prank. I think those two kids walked down that bank to the flat area&#x2014;and something happened.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Something took them,&#x201d; he said slowly.</p><p>Sarah nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the only thing I could think of. It&#x2019;s like something just swooped down and carried them away. And judging by the footprints, they had to be lifted cleanly, straight up. No sign of a struggle. No sign of a fight. There are houses close enough to hear if someone had screamed. Even in the middle of the night.&#x201d; Without turning, she jerked her head back and toward the other side of the road. &#x201c;Mildred Bates is watching us from her front porch now; she sleeps with her windows open and the slightest sound wakes her. Her bedroom windows face this way. Less than fifty yards from here to there. If there had been any kind of a commotion, she would have heard&#x2014;and called us. She didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So, where are those kids?&#x201d; Jonah said slowly. &#x201c;And how the hell did they just . . . vanish?&#x201d;</p><p>Jonah didn&#x2019;t voice what he felt, that what they were looking at was not exactly an ending&#x2014;but the beginning of something. The beginning of something bad. The beginning of something that was going to shake his town to its foundations.</p></p><h2>Found in Him: The Joy of the Incarnation and Our Union with Christ</h2><p><p><strong>We Were Lost. Now We&#x2019;re Found...<em>in Him</em>.</strong></p><p>Everyone has experienced isolation and alienation. We lost more than a nice home when we were banished from Eden. We lost relationship with God and with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>But then God did the unthinkable. The Son of God became the Man Christ Jesus: one of <em>us</em> that we might be united to <em>him</em>.</p><p>In <em>Found in Him</em>, Elyse Fitzpatrick explores the wonder of the incarnation and the glory of our union with Christ, offering us a sure path to ultimate acceptance and true belonging through the power of the gospel.</p></p><p><p><strong>Elyse Fitzpatrick</strong>&nbsp;(MA, Trinity Theological Seminary) is a counselor, a retreat and conference speaker, and the author of over twenty books, including&nbsp;<em>Because He Loves Me</em>;&nbsp;<em>Comforts from the Cross</em>; and&nbsp;<em>Found in Him</em>.</p><p>author, <em>Give Them Grace</em></p><p>&#x201c;Busy Christians in an iPhone age can look at Christ as though he were the battery charger and we are the smartphone. We &#x2018;plug into&#x2019; Jesus during a quiet time, then go out and live on that energy until our spiritual batteries run dry&#x2015;then it&#x2019;s back to the next quiet time, conference, or retreat. But this is not a metaphor the Bible invites us to use when it speaks of our union in Christ. He is the vine; we are the branches. In her newest and perhaps most important work, my friend Elyse Fitzpatrick describes this beautiful union we have with our Savior and the joys of drawing from the Vine. I highly recommend this exceptional book!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Joni Eareckson Tada,</strong> Founder, Joni and Friends</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Found in Him</em> reveals the God-designed remedy for our impoverished hearts&#x2015;the work of Christ for, in, and through us. While many heavy-laden, conscience-stricken believers struggle to bear up under the weight of their spiritual &#x2018;to-do&#x2019; lists, Elyse awakens our hearts and minds to what Jesus has already done and calls us to find rest in him.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Nancy DeMoss Wolgemuth,</strong> author, <em>Adorned</em>; Teacher and Host, <em>Revive Our Hearts</em></p><p>&#x201c;Fasten your seatbelt and get ready for a theological thrill ride. I&#x2019;m not talking about spiritual entertainment&#x2015;you best look elsewhere for that. But if you are looking to understand one of the most profound and moving mysteries of the Christian life&#x2015;as Elyse puts it, &#x2018;the soul-consoling, heart-transforming, zeal-engendering&#x2019; of Christ&#x2019;s incarnation and union with us&#x2015;well, you&#x2019;ve found the book you absolutely need to read.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Mark Galli,</strong> Editor in Chief, <em>Christianity Today</em></p><p>&#x201c;If Elyse Fitzpatrick is right, the Bible (finally) is not about us at all! It is about the God who has acted to save those who <em>don&#x2019;t</em> and <em>can&#x2019;t</em> &#x2018;become better,&#x2019; and that Christianity is <em>not</em> (finally) about &#x2018;morals&#x2019; at all. The Bible&#x2019;s story is a story about God&#x2019;s love for <em>immorals</em> like you and me. It is about Christ, who he is and what he did <em>for</em> us&#x2013;&#x2013;once and for all and at a particular time and place in normal history.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Rod Rosenbladt,</strong> Professor of Theology, Concordia University</p><p>&#x201c;When the great theologian John Murray famously wrote, &#x2018;Union with Christ is really the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation,&#x2019; I wonder how I could have missed the point for so many years. Yet, as I simply consider the focus of Christ and the apostles on being &#x2018;in him,&#x2019; I have grown to recognize the wisdom of Murray&#x2019;s words and now, with Elyse Fitzpatrick&#x2019;s book, I also cherish the dearness of them. She writes of the deep truths of our union with God, freshly unfolding biblical passages that describe his incarnation, and she writes with sensitivity of the significance of the continuing intimacy we have with the Creator who walked among us. Here is the infinite made intimate to strengthen our hearts.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bryan Chapell,</strong>&nbsp;Senior Pastor, Grace Presbyterian Church, Peoria, Illinois</p><p>&#x201c;Over the years, I have been challenged by Elyse&#x2019;s profound and practical approach to biblical issues that concern women. Last year when I heard her share a snippet of her writing on the incarnation, I was hungry for more&#x2015;and I wasn&#x2019;t disappointed! Pondering the incarnation, in my moments of loneliness and brokenness, has been the strong medicine I need to soothe and heal my heart, and I trust it will be yours as well.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Cathe Laurie,</strong> Director of Women&#x2019;s Ministry, Harvest Christian Fellowship</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Found in Him</em> is a timely paean to the timeless good news of Christ&#x2019;s incarnation and our union with him. As with everything Elyse writes, it brims with humility and imagination, and the focus on grace is sharp and undeviating. She never flinches from honesty about who we are, which only makes the &#x2018;comfort and joy&#x2019; of what Jesus has done on our behalf that much greater. Would that more of us had her courage (and good humor)!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>David Zahl,</strong> editor, The Mockingbird Blog</p><p>&#x201c;This book is a celebration of the person and work of Jesus. Elyse wisely and winsomely shows us the deep wonders of what it means to be found in Jesus. Her theological maturity enables her to write with profound simplicity. This is a book to be savored. Read it slowly, and stop often to worship the one who found you and made you his own. Then read it again.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Susan Hunt,</strong>&nbsp;Former Director of Women's Ministries, PCA; coauthor, <em>Women's Ministry in the Local Church</em></p><p>&#x201c;This new book by Elyse warms my heart. She beautifully elaborates on Christ and who he is and what he has accomplished for us. In the later half of <em>Found in Him</em>, she shows us how to apply and live out this Good News. Expect your life to change.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Charles Morris,</strong> speaker; President, HAVEN Today</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard for me to capture how thankful I am for this book. As Elyse is so skilled at doing, she has taken the doctrine of our union with Christ, which sits and collects dust on the shelves of most Christians&#x2019; theology and has little impact on their living, and displayed for us the beauty of its transformative power. When you don&#x2019;t understand the essential provisions that have been made for you in your union with Christ, you sadly spend your life shopping for what is already yours in him. I will recommend and give away this book again and again and will celebrate with new enthusiasm that I have been found in him!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Paul David Tripp,</strong> President, Paul Tripp Ministries; author, <em>New Morning Mercies</em> and <em>Suffering</em></p><p>&#x201c;Resist the temptation to think that a book on the incarnation of Christ and our union with him couldn&#x2019;t help but be dull, dry, and doctrinally abstract. Elyse Fitzpatrick couldn&#x2019;t be dull if she tried! This is a rich, incisive, thoroughly scriptural, and heart-warming journey into the gospel of who Jesus is and what he has done to unite us to himself. Elyse&#x2019;s portrait of Jesus and our life in him will do more than challenge and inform; it will awaken awe at the depths of God&#x2019;s grace and stir adoration for the one who loved you and gave himself for you. Read and rejoice! I did.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Sam Storms,</strong>&nbsp;Senior Pastor, Bridgeway Church, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</p><p>&#x201c;One of my favorite experiences was eating at a chocolate buffet at the Cailler chocolate factory, in Broc, Switzerland. Reading Elyse&#x2019;s new book, <em>Found in Him</em>, reminded me of that day. Our sister has spread the table with the richest of gospel fare and has invited us to behold, feast, and savor every good thing we have in Christ. This is the finest meditation I have ever read on the radical implications of the incarnation of Christ and our &#x2018;this-changes-everything&#x2019; union with him. Highly accessible, theologically sound, and eminently encouraging, Elyse has once again clearly demonstrated that there&#x2019;s nothing more <em>than</em> the gospel, there&#x2019;s just more <em>of</em> the gospel.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Scotty Ward Smith,</strong> Pastor Emeritus, Christ Community Church, Franklin, Tennessee; Teacher in Residence, West End Community Church, Nashville, Tennessee</p><p>&#x201c;In her treatment of the incarnation of Christ and our union with him, Elyse Fitzpatrick has given us an insightful and compelling presentation of these insufficiently celebrated truths. And she sets them forth not just as truths but as realities that profoundly touch our daily lives&#x2015;truths which are, in fact, meant to touch our lives deeply and powerfully. To paraphrase Elyse, &#x2018;O how impoverished our souls will be if we neglect these sweet doctrines.&#x2019; I have often told students to read books that make you want to read your Bible more. Here is such a book. I turned often to my Bible, with great joy, while reading <em>Found in Him</em>.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Mike Bullmore</strong>, Senior Pastor, CrossWay Community Church, Bristol, Wisconsin</p><p>&#x201c;As Elyse says in this book, there is truly a feast to be found in understanding and meditating on the truth of our union with Christ. This doctrine has transformed how I understand myself and empowered me in healthy relationships with others. Elyse&#x2019;s <em>Found in Him</em> is a beautiful exploration of these truths, and I am excited that this resource is now available.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Wendy Horger Alsup,</strong>&nbsp;teacher;&nbsp;blogger; author,<em>&nbsp;Is the Bible Good for Women?&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;Practical Theology for Women</em></p><p>&#x201c;Elyse Fitzpatrick&#x2019;s writings are always saturated with gospel grace, understanding, and wisdom, and <em>Found in Him</em> is no different. With clarity and warmth Elyse meditates on how God answers our isolation and enters into our suffering through the incarnation of Jesus. In Christ we are not alone, and we are part of something much bigger than ourselves. I am thankful for Elyse&#x2019;s ministry and for this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Justin S.

Whether in his union with humanity by virtue of the incarnation or through indwelling the believer by the Holy Spirit, all Christians should know Christ, the one to whom they are united. This book is an able guide to understanding these glorious truths.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>J. V. Fesko,</strong> Professor of Systematic and Historical Theology, Westminster Seminary California</p><p>&#x201c;Many of us, if we are honest, have an image of God as the one who is far above us and far away from us. Few of us know our Trinitarian God as so close to us that he is in us and we are in him. My friend Elyse Fitzpatrick takes the doctrine of the incarnation and teaches us that we are not alone&#x2015;God is with us! Elyse then takes the doctrine of our union with Christ and shows us the soul-altering significance of our connection and communion with God in Christ. <em>Found in Him</em> is not just theology come alive, it is theology for life&#x2015;for your life and mine.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Robert W.

Sounds too good to be true, but it's not. Join Bonnie K. Hunter as she shows you how to get your scraps organized into usable sizes &#x2013; and save money, fabric, thread and time. In this, the long-awaited sequel to Adventures with Leaders and Enders, find 12 more scrap quilts that can be pieced in between the lines of other sewing. Each is sure to inspire you to dig into your stash and start piecing.</p><p>Bonnie K. Hunter started quilting in the 1980&#39;s and never looked back. Since 2009 she has been teaching an travelling and in 2013 she won best teacher, author, designer, best new book release and lifetime achievement awards through a global internet poll hosted via Sew Cal Gal. She writes regularly for Quiltmaker magazine. You can catch up with Bonnie at her extensive website Quiltville.com and her blog Quiltville.blogspot.com.I am a huge fan of Bonnie&#39;s technique. By using the start and the end of the fabric you are already sewing together you can create amazing quilts. The other brilliant thing is it isn&#39;t going to take you any extra time to get all the pieces prepared. The thing I also love about Bonnie&#39;s books is that you get patterns so that if you are not sure how to put your quilt together you don&#39;t need to worry. Bonnie&#39;s designs mean that no matter you colour of fabric you&#39;ll be able to put one of the designs together. The designs run from more traditional designs to ones with a more modern twist. This book will not only teach you Bonnie&#39;s technique it will inspire and motivate you. The templates aren&#39;t included but most of the designs use basic squares, triangles etc that you would normally make anyway. Scraps of fabric lying around will be a thing of the past. You&#39;ll be surprised how quickly you can make up quilt&#39;s from the squares etc. you have made. I truly believe Bonnie&#39;s technique of using leaders and enders is a one that all quilters should learn about! http://www.crochetaddictuk.com/2015/12/more-adventures-with-leaders-and-enders.html -- Crochet Addict UK</p><h2>Unholy Night</h2><p>From the author of the <em>New York Times </em>bestselling <em>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</em><em>, </em>comes UNHOLY NIGHT, the next evolution in dark historical revisionism. <br><br>They're an iconic part of history's most celebrated birth. But what do we really know about the Three Kings of the Nativity, besides the fact that they followed a star to Bethlehem bearing strange gifts? The Bible has little to say about this enigmatic trio.

But when Herod's men begin to slaughter the first born in Judea, he has no choice but to help them escape to Egypt. <br><br>It's the beginning of an adventure that will see them fight the last magical creatures of the Old Testament; cross paths with biblical figures like Pontius Pilate and John the Baptist; and finally deliver them to Egypt.

Perhaps because the country feels like it is located at the end of the world, most Argentines are born with a good dose of wanderlust, and Flores-Vianna had a higher dose than normal. Books helped him discover places both literally and figuratively, creating romantic visions of lands he wanted to visit, and he has gone on to document his peripatetic life with his camera, recording places as he feels they should be rather than as they are. In this irresistible volume, Flores-Vianna shares some 250 of his favorite images taken all over Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas&#x2014;captured only with his smartphone&#x2014;in the hope that viewers, seeing the world through his eyes, will learn to love these most wondrous of places as much as he does.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Miguel Flores-Vianna</b> has been a photographer, writer, and editor for more than 20 years.

Compiled here for the first time are more than 200 publicity stills and photos of some of America's first "It" girls&#x2014;the silent film-era starlets who paved the way for the cacophony of Monroes and Madonnas to follow. Accompanying these iconic images are the stories behind them, including accounts from surviving Ziegfeld Girls, as well as ads featuring them that helped perpetuate the allure of It girl glamour. When rare and striking portraits of these women surfaced on the internet in 1995, author Robert Hudovernik began researching their source. What he discovered was the work of one of the first "star makers" identified most with the Ziegfeld Follies, Alfred Cheney Johnston. Johnston, a member of New York's famous Algonquin Round Table who photographed such celebrities as Mary Pickford, Fanny Brice, the Gish Sisters, and Louise Brooks, fell out of the spotlight with the demise of the revue.

But an afternoon out on the waves turns stressful when Trot brings her grandfather, who has dementia, with her to the beach and he wanders off. The authorities find him, but Trot's worried mother grounds Trot and her grandfather. When Trot and Cap'n Bill sneak out for a quick surf, they get knocked off their board and interrupt an underwater battle between the ancient Sea Sirens and their rivals, the menacing Serpents. Joined by Trot's grandfather, who followed them when they left home, Trot and Cap'n Bill have a fun evening with the regal Sea Sirens until the duo learn that Grandpa has wandered off again-this time, into the clutches of the Serpents. This is a light, low-stakes read that will resonate with those who enjoy spending time with lovable characters. Lee's stylized artwork and gorgeous colors will appeal to the tweenage set, while Chu's simple dialogue keeps things accessible to young comics fans. Though Trot and Cap'n Bill have a charming dynamic and energy, Trot's family and the Sirens and Serpents are lacking in depth.

And the biggest scandal of the Clinton years didn&#x2019;t involve an intern in a blue dress. <br><br> Surprised? Don&#x2019;t be. In America, where history is riddled with misrepresentations, misunderstandings, and flat-out lies about the people and events that have shaped the nation, there&#x2019;s the history you know and then there&#x2019;s the truth. In <i>33 Questions About American History You&#x2019;re Not Supposed to Ask</i>,<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author Thomas E. Woods Jr. reveals the tough questions about our nation&#x2019;s history that have long been buried because they&#x2019;re too politically incorrect to discuss, including:<br><br> Are liberals really so antiwar?<br><br> Was the Civil War all about slavery?<br><br> Did the Framers really look to the American Indians as the model for the U.S. political system?<br><br> Did Bill Clinton actually stop a genocide in Kosovo, as we&#x2019;re told?<br><br> The answer to all those questions is no.

WOODS JR. is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and contributing editor of <i>The American Conservative</i>.QUESTION1<br><br>Did the Founding Fathers Support Immigration?<br><br>Though polls consistently find that a majority of Americans believe immigration levels need to be reduced, many people still assume that the right of immigration is a hallowed American principle that no loyal citizen can consistently oppose.<br><br>This assumption is false.<br><br>Actually, the Founding Fathers were generally wary of immigration. They did not wish to exclude it altogether, but they saw no particular need to encourage it, especially among migrants whose cultural backgrounds were significantly different from their own.<br><br>Consider Benjamin Franklin, that well-known cosmopolite and child of the Enlightenment. Franklin, it turns out, said quite a few politically incorrect things about non-British humanity (a category that includes the present writer). On one occasion he asked, "Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the English, become a colony of aliens, who will shortly be so numerous as to Germanize us, instead of our Anglifying them, and will never adopt our language or customs any more than they can acquire our complexion?" Thus immigrants of sufficient number and concentration could radically change the cultural landscape in ways that the native population might not want.<br><br>We can already hear the modern liberal laughing at Franklin, pointing triumphantly to German assimilation in America as proof that the Pennsylvanian's concerns were without merit. But the point here is simply this: if unrestricted immigration had really been a traditional American principle, someone must have forgotten to tell Benjamin Franklin. And he was speaking of people who, as fellow heirs and architects of Western civilization, shared a great deal in common with the original settlers of British America. One can only imagine what Franklin would have had to say about current immigration policy.<br><br>JEFFERSON AND HAMILTON ON IMMIGRATION<br><br>Franklin was not alone. Thomas Jefferson's warning about mass immigration in his Notes on Virginia would doubtless come as a surprise to most Americans, since most American history textbooks for some reason choose not to highlight it. Jefferson asked suggestively, "Are there no inconveniences to be thrown into the scale against the advantage expected by a multiplication of numbers by the importation of foreigners?"<br><br>"It is for the happiness of those united in society," the sage of Monticello went on to explain, "to harmonize as much as possible, in matters which they must of necessity transact together. Civil government being the sole object of forming societies, its administration must be conducted by common consent." Our government was "a composition of the freest principles of the English Constitution, with others, derived from natural right and reason." Nothing could be more opposed to the principles of our government than those of absolute monarchies, said Jefferson. But it was from such regimes that we could expect the most immigrants.<br><br>Such immigrants, Jefferson feared, would "bring with them the principles of the governments they leave, imbibed in their early youth; or, if able to throw them off, it will be in exchange for an unbounded licentiousness, passing, as is usual, from one extreme to another. It would be a miracle were they to stop precisely at the point of temperate liberty." A large influx of immigrants from places without any experience with our kind of government and society could only introduce confusion and discord. "These principles, with their language, they will transmit to their children. In proportion to their numbers, they will share with us the legislation. They will infuse into it their spirit, warp and bias its direction, and render it a heterogeneous, incoherent, distracted mass."<br><br>Jefferson concluded that it was "safer" to wait patiently for the natural increase of the American population rather than achieve such increase by mass immigration, and that our government would, as a result, be more peaceable and more durable. He left readers with a useful thought experiment: "Suppose 20 millions of republican Americans [were] thrown all of a sudden into France, what would be the condition of that kingdom? If it would be more turbulent, less happy, less strong, we may believe that the addition of half a million of foreigners to our present numbers would produce a similar effect here."<br><br>Jefferson was joined in his wariness by Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first secretary of the treasury. In his draft of a speech for George Washington, Hamilton wrote: "To render the people of this country as homogenous as possible, must tend as much as any other circumstance to the permanence of their union and posterity."<br><br>Several years later, when Jefferson called for liberalizing the naturalization laws in his December 1801 message to Congress, Hamilton recalled Jefferson's earlier sentiments from Notes on Virginia. (This change of heart appears to have been of partisan origin: Jefferson himself, along with several of his prominent opponents, believed that the foreign vote had won him the election of 1800.) He agreed with Jefferson that it was praiseworthy for the United States to permit the entry of those experiencing genuine hardship and seeking asylum, though even here Hamilton would have reminded his fellow citizens that generosity has its limits if the welfare of the country is to be protected. What he objected to was the suggestion that all such people were necessarily entitled to the privileges of citizenship. He concluded by pointing out that even granting for the sake of argument that American Indians had extended nothing but friendship as the colonists arrived on these shores, it was important to consider the fate of a people whose policy was so magnanimous. "Prudence requires us," Hamilton wrote, "to trace the history further and ask what has become of the nations of savages who exercised this policy, and who now occupies the territory which they then inhabited? Perhaps a lesson is here taught which ought not to be despised." (The American Indians, in short, had a severe immigration problem.)<br><br>Hamilton described the safety of a republic as depending "essentially on the energy of a common national sentiment; on a uniformity of principles and habits; on the exemption of the citizens from foreign bias, and prejudice; and on that love of country which will almost invariably be found to be closely connected with birth, education, and family." He then drew out the implications of this point:<br><br>The influx of foreigners must, therefore, tend to produce a heterogeneous compound; to change and corrupt the national spirit; to complicate and confound public opinion; to introduce foreign propensities. In the composition of society, the harmony of the ingredients is all-important, and whatever tends to a discordant intermixture must have an injurious tendency.<br><br>For Hamilton, immigration policy was a matter of prudence and good sense, not a moral imperative. He observed at the turn of the nineteenth century that "in the infancy of the country, with a boundless waste to people, it was politic to give a facility to naturalization; but our situation is now changed. It appears from the last census that we have increased about one third in ten years; after allowing for what we have gained from abroad, it will be quite apparent that the natural progress of our own population is sufficiently rapid for strength, security, and settlement."<br><br>THE RIGHT TO EXCLUDE<br><br>Still others echoed these sentiments. Writing to John Adams in 1794, George Washington contended that the United States had no real reason to encourage immigration. Washington said that "except of useful mechanics and some particular descriptions of men or professions, there is no need of encouragement [of immigration], while the policy or advantage of its taking place in a body (I mean the settling of them in a body) may be much questioned; for by so doing, they retain the Language, habits, and principles (good or bad) which they bring with them."<br><br>Rufus King, who had attended the Constitutional Convention as a delegate from Massachusetts, was concerned about the character of the immigrants whom America might attract. He wrote in a 1798 letter, "It was the practice of the Emigrants from Scotland to bring with them Certificates from the religious Societies to which they belonged, of their honesty, sobriety, and generally of their good Character! Why should we not require some such Document from all Emigrants, and it would be well to add to the Testimonial that the person to whom it was granted was not expelled from his Country and had not been convicted of any crime." King wondered, "If from the emigrations of past time we have suffered inconvenience and our true national character has been disfigured, what are we to expect from the Emigrants of the present Day?"<br><br>John Jay, who would become the first chief justice of the United States, in Federalist No. 2 positively celebrated the fact that for all its "diversity," the United States consisted essentially of people whose religious and cultural traits were broadly similar and compatible, rather than widely divergent and a potential threat to social comity. "Providence," he wrote, "has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people--a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs."<br><br>According to Thomas G. West, a professor at the University of Dallas, "None of the Founders gave a theoretical account of the right of a political community to exclude would-be immigrants. That is because such a right was obvious to all as an inference from the general principles they all shared. No one in the early debates in Congress on the naturalization laws doubted the government's right to determine exclusionary criteria for citizenship."<br><br>At the Constitutional Convention, for example, New York's Gouverneur Morris warned of being "polite at the expense of prudence." He noted that the privileges that immigrants enjoyed in the United States were considerably greater than in the rest of the world, but he concluded by reminding his listeners that "every Society from a great Nation down to a Club had the right of declaring the conditions on which new members should be admitted."<br><br>The Founding Fathers' views on immigration do not by themselves settle the modern debate, of course. But they remain one of the best-kept secrets of American history.<br><br>QUESTION2<br><br>Did Martin Luther King Jr. oppose affirmative action?<br><br>Here's a case in which liberals have it right and at least some conservatives have it wrong: the philosophy of Martin Luther King Jr.<br><br>The way some conservatives tell it, King believed in an absolutely color-blind approach to racial issues and policy in America. Instead of calling for massive government programs and preferential policies in favor of blacks, King simply demanded of white America that it view individuals on their merits rather than in light of racial prejudice. After all, he envisioned a society in which, as he said so memorably in his "I Have a Dream" speech in Washington in 1963, "my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."<br><br>Thus, this line of reasoning goes, King was demanding only basic libertarian rights of equal treatment before the law. Compensatory programs on behalf of blacks, to say nothing of quota systems and other special privileges, were anathema to him, since they, just as much as segregation, violated his color-blind principles.<br><br>For years, the Left has complained that this interpretation of King's thought grossly distorts the man's views, rendering his truly radical message toothless and tame. And in this case the Left is absolutely right. No one interested in the truth and familiar with King's thought could portray it so inaccurately.<br><br>A GIGANTIC "BILL OF RIGHTS FOR THE DISADVANTAGED"<br><br>The main problem with the conservative claim upon King is that absolutely nothing in King's economic thought supports it. King wanted immediate improvement in the material condition of blacks, and he was prepared to resort to radical measures in order to achieve that goal. He was manifestly not in favor of the free market, which he indicted with the same series of cliches evident throughout the political Left.<br><br>King condemned the suggestion that "if the Negro is to rise out of poverty, if the Negro is to rise out of slum conditions, if he is to rise out of discrimination and segregation, he must do it all by himself." Rather, King taught, "the roots of racism are very deep in our country, and there must be something positive and massive in order to get rid of all the effects of racism and the tragedies of injustice." It was not enough that the nation leave behind racial prejudice. The United States "must not only radically readjust its attitude toward the Negro in the compelling present, but must incorporate in its planning some compensatory consideration for the handicaps he has inherited from the past."<br><br>Some conservatives have tried to claim that King and the civil rights movement in general sought only equality of basic rights and little, if anything, that would involve real coercion. But in fact King sought an immediate, palpable improvement in blacks' material condition. Especially revealing is his insistence that the black man in his day was "not struggling for some abstract, vague rights, but for a concrete and prompt improvement in his way of life."<br><br>How, exactly, did King propose that this "concrete and prompt improvement" be achieved? For one thing, he most certainly believed in preferential policies for blacks, particularly in management positions. And in Why We Can't Wait, King spelled out the nature of a compensatory package for blacks that he considered fair:<br><br>No amount of gold could provide an adequate compensation for the exploitation and humiliation of the Negro in America down through the centuries. Not all the wealth of this affluent society could meet the bill. Yet a price can be placed on unpaid wages. The ancient common law has always provided a remedy for the appropriation of the labor of one human being by another. This law should be made to apply for American Negroes. The payment should be in the form of a massive program by the government of special, compensatory measures which could be regarded as a settlement in accordance with the accepted practice of common law. Such measures would certainly be less expensive than any computation based on two centuries of unpaid wages and accumulated interest. I am proposing, therefore, that just as we granted a GI Bill of Rights to war veterans, America launch a broad-based and gigantic Bill of Rights for the Disadvantaged, our veterans of the long siege of denial.<br><br>RADICALISM<br><br>King grew more and more radical toward the end of his life, occasionally repudiating milder positions he had held earlier. "I am sorry to have to say," he remarked in 1967, "that the vast majority of white Americans are racists, either consciously or unconsciously." Reflecting on the state of American society, he said: "For years I labored with the idea of reforming the existing institutions of the society, a little change here, a little change there. I think you've got to have a reconstruction of the entire society, a revolution of values."</p><h2>Obsessed: A Memoir of My Life with OCD</h2><p>A brave teen recounts her debilitating struggle with obsessive-compulsive disorder&#x2014;and brings readers through every painful step as she finds her way to the other side&#x2014;in this powerful and inspiring memoir.<br><br>Until sophomore year of high school, fifteen-year-old Allison Britz lived a comfortable life in an idyllic town. She was a dedicated student with tons of extracurricular activities, friends, and loving parents at home.<br> <br>But after awakening from a vivid nightmare in which she was diagnosed with brain cancer, she was convinced the dream had been a warning. Allison believed that she must do something to stop the cancer in her dream from becoming a reality.<br> <br>It started with avoiding sidewalk cracks and quickly grew to counting steps as loudly as possible.

When not spending all of her money on books, she enjoys cooking, three-day weekends, arguing with her OCD, and extensive Netflix binges. She lives in Manhattan with her husband and their dog. <i>Obsessed</i>&nbsp;is her first book.Obsessed CHAPTER 1<p></p> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think the pigs smell me. I think they see me,&#x201d; Ms. Griffin says, reenacting last night&#x2019;s assigned reading from Lord of the Flies. She pretends to apply mud to her face and body like war paint and crouches down, ready for the hunt. Overweight in a way that reminds me pleasantly of my grandmother, with her frizzy, out-of-control hair flying in all directions, she scuttles in between the desks at the front of the room, a ruler raised high in the air as a spear.<br> <br>In the fourth row, third chair back, I am using Lauren Madison&#x2019;s hair as a shield to stay out of Ms. Griffin&#x2019;s line of vision. I spend most English classes annoyed with Lauren&#x2019;s blond, conditioned locks&#x2014;the way they tumble beautifully across my desk and how they smell like expensive shampoo and roses. Today, however, her mane provides a convenient wall to hide behind while I study for my upcoming sixth-period chemistry test. I am feverishly attempting to memorize the molecular formula of a long list of compounds, most of which I have never heard of outside a chemistry textbook. Head bent forward, pencil streaming across the page, I am writing and rewriting the formula for glucose as I simultaneously whisper it to myself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Allison, what about you?&#x201d;<br> <br>I look up from my mound of notes, mouth agape. C6H12O6. C6H12O6.<br> <br>&#x201c;Allison, hi. Yes, join us, please. Put away whatever else it is you&#x2019;re working on. What are your thoughts on the question?&#x201d;<br> <br>Blank stare.<br> <br>&#x201c;I asked what you think about the mounting tension between Roger and Jack?&#x201d;<br> <br>I continue to look at her, openmouthed. My subconscious clanks and grunts, struggling to shift to a new train of thought. Lord of the Flies. Focus. My mind is silent, my stomach tightening more with each second. Ms. Griffin, sweating slightly from her pretend spear hunt, locks eyes with me from behind her podium at the front of the class. I can see that she is enjoying this.<br> <br>I am the girl who other students don&#x2019;t want in their classes. Brimming with anecdotes and opinions, I am the girl who raises her hand when the teacher asks, &#x201c;Are there any questions?&#x201d; I am the student, to the chorus of groans from my peers, who reminds the teacher when she forgot to pick up our homework assignment from the night before. The tense silence continues as I search my brain for anything that&#x2019;s not an atomic symbol. I glance at her, a plea for mercy, but she doesn&#x2019;t flinch. See if I rescue you next time no one is participating in your class discussion, I think moodily. Gradually, my classmates turn around to look at me. They&#x2019;re torn from their bored stupor by the fact that somehow Allison, the girl who was voted Most Intellectual in the eighth-grade yearbook, didn&#x2019;t do the previous night&#x2019;s assigned reading.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I . . . think . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>My eyes dart around the room, looking desperately for assistance. I make eye contact with Greg Sauers, and he just shrugs at me. How did she even see me behind Lauren&#x2019;s hair?<br> <br>&#x201c;I think . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, Samuelson High, it&#x2019;s Thursday, and you know what that means!&#x201d; My hesitant mumbling is interrupted by an announcement crackling through the school&#x2019;s intercom system. A peppy female voice echoes against the whitewashed cinder-block walls. &#x201c;Thursdays mean JV football, Bulldogs fans, and tonight we are facing none other than Hamilton High School.&#x201d; A low-toned &#x201c;Boooooo&#x201d; lilts through the hallways. &#x201c;Make sure you come out and support your JV boys tonight at eight p.m.! As always, go, Bulldogs!&#x201d; With her last syllables, the bell rings, and the entire class lurches into action. Saved by the intercom, I quickly gather my disarrayed chemistry notes into my binder and dodge through the crowded classroom, launching myself into the hallway to avoid Ms. Griffin. I make a mental note to myself to catch up on Lord of the Flies tonight. After that performance, Ms. Griffin will likely target me again in the future, if only for her own entertainment.<br> <br>&#x201c;Allison, hey!&#x201d; The familiar soprano voice of my best friend, Sara, lofts over the chaotic hallway scene. In my rush to escape, I completely forgot to wait for her outside class like I always do. In the strict social hierarchy of Samuelson, many unspoken guidelines govern the student body. One of the most important: Never walk anywhere by yourself. In between classes, on the way to lunch, after school in the parking lot, have enough pride to never be seen alone. Sara is my best friend, of course, but also a convenient built-in walking partner.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dude, Ms. Griffin totally called you out. It&#x2019;s like she has some sort of radar or something. She only calls on me when I forget to do the reading,&#x201d; Sara complains. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s as if she can see the guilt in our eyes.&#x201d;<br> <br>I let out an exasperated breath before she even finishes her sentence. Sara has been my closest friend since she sat next to me on the first day of summer camp when we were nine. She is pretty in a way that tells you she&#x2019;s been told it her entire life. Her raucous auburn curls and winged eyeliner are the antithesis to my simple blond bob and light mascara. Her Rolling Stones T-shirt clashes with my pink cardigan and pearls.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, first of all, you never do the reading, and second, I didn&#x2019;t forget to do the homework.&#x201d; I cast her a sidelong glance with a slight headshake for good measure, acting more annoyed than I am. &#x201c;I have a chemistry test this afternoon and I was up all night studying, so I didn&#x2019;t have time to do the assignment. It&#x2019;s called prioritizing. I&#x2019;ll catch up on her reading after this test.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All night? Get a grip, girl!&#x201d; Sara exclaims with concern in her eyes, an edge of judgment in her voice. Since childhood, she has proclaimed it her mission to get me to &#x201c;take the stick out.&#x201d; &#x201c;Life is too short for this. You haven&#x2019;t been to one JV football game this year.&#x201d;<br> <br>False. &#x201c;Hello, I&#x2019;ve been with you twice already! You know cross-country practice goes until seven and the football games start at eight. An hour isn&#x2019;t enough time to get home, shower, change. It&#x2019;s just not worth it. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah, I know. And you do the long loop on Thursdays.&#x201d; Sara isn&#x2019;t on the cross-country team, but by now she knows our workout schedule by heart.<br> <br>&#x201c;Exactly. We do the long loop on Thursdays. Seven miles. I&#x2019;m so exhausted when I get home. Sweaty, sore. Making it to a football game afterwards is just a lot for one night. Not to mention having to do homework after we get back at almost midnight.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m trying to sound resolute, but it comes out more like a whine.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, well . . .&#x201d; She pauses and, glancing around to ensure secrecy, half whispers, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just say you&#x2019;re not going to get anywhere with Sam with a social schedule like that.&#x201d; We look at each other, and she shrugs. &#x201c;Look, he asked you out for ice cream, y&#x2019;all ate some delicious treats together and laughed a bit. Then he texted you two consecutive days in a row. Two!&#x201d; She stares at me intently, her pointer and middle fingers in the air as a visual aid. &#x201c;Now it&#x2019;s been what, five days, including a weekend, since you&#x2019;ve heard from him? You have to do something.&#x201d; She is emphatic, energized. If we were standing still, I know she would have stomped her foot. &#x201c;He always goes to the Thursday football games&#x2014;the whole basketball team does. Tonight after practice, drive home, take the fastest shower of your life, and then come over to my house. I&#x2019;ll do your hair and makeup and we&#x2019;ll get his attention.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sara grabs my hand and beams at me, and suddenly, optimistically, I have changed my mind about the night ahead. I see myself sitting in front of a mirror, in a bathroom almost as familiar as my own, as she straightens my hair and gives me a lesson on bronzer. &#x201c;Look&#x201d;&#x2014;she leans in and whispers from the side of her mouth&#x2014;&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re nervous. I know it&#x2019;s scary. So let me help.&#x201d;<br> <br>We make brief eye contact and she shows a small smile. My heart swells with gratitude for her and her genuine concern for my prom prospects. She doesn&#x2019;t know that I check my phone multiple times a minute hoping to see Sam appear on the screen. She has no idea that I chewed all my fingernails off last night while playing our ice-cream-date conversation on a loop in my head. Only I can feel how much his sudden silence is gnawing at my insides, but she can tell, just from being beside me, just from being my closest friend, that I need a little help.<br> <br>It seems so recently that we were eating ice cream. After we chose flavors, after he paid (he paid!), I looked out the window at the rainy, dreary day and made a comment about how sad and ugly the weather was. He put his arm around me, looked me in the eye, our faces four inches apart, and said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay. You more than make up for it.&#x201d; His breath smelled like Juicy Fruit.<br> <br>And now he&#x2019;s MIA.<br> <br>For almost a week I have been placating myself with tales of broken cell phones or dead grandmas or any number of fluke accidents that might have prevented him from texting me. He is probably starting to grow fearful of just how much he cares about me, I&#x2019;ve told myself. Our spark is too intense for his soft, sensitive skin.<br> <br>But, as always, Sara speaks the truth: He is losing interest. It is time to act.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, yeah, fine. I&#x2019;ll come to your house as fast as I can after practice. We can just be a little late for the game.&#x201d; I nudge her happily with my shoulder. &#x201c;Gotta go to Civics,&#x201d; I say as I pivot ninety degrees to enter the nearby brick building.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have a good day!&#x201d; she throws over her shoulder as we part ways. &#x201c;And make sure you keep all those chemistry notes. I&#x2019;m going to need to use them next year.&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Nine hours later, I reach the top of the stairs and let my book bag fall onto the kitchen floor with a heavy thud. Every week we run that same seven-mile loop, and every week I question why I subject myself to a sport that feels like cruel and unusual punishment. Because it looks good on my r�sum�, I tell myself. Because it keeps me fit. Because that&#x2019;s where most of my friends are.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a relief to be home. I collapse into one of the chairs at my kitchen table. Our sprawling house is dark, lit only by the fading evening sun pushing weakly through the windows. My neighborhood, Blakely Farms, is one of the more affluent in town, and I wear our address like a badge of pride, despite my complete lack of involvement in our financial success. There is a swimming pool with a competitive swim team, a pond with an unnecessarily large fountain, playgrounds in every backyard.<br> <br>Chemistry test and cross-country practice behind me, I am finally feeling the full burden of yesterday&#x2019;s all-nighter. I know I need to put some effort into my social life, to see and be seen. But I&#x2019;m just so exhausted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, hey, sweetheart!&#x201d; my mom drawls, walking down the hallway toward me. Her hair is still perfectly coiffed and sprayed from a day at the office, but she has changed into what she calls her comfy clothes and what the rest of the world calls a ten-year-old sweatpants set and fuzzy socks with grips on the bottom. A former army captain, she has yet to abandon both her regulation haircut and her strict attention to timeliness, rules, and regulations. As she walks across the kitchen, I almost hear her reciting to herself, Left, left, left, right, left. My mother is a corporate powerhouse, the family breadwinner. Sara calls her the Hillary Clinton of human resources. She is the VP of Everything and lives up to her reputation with an impressive collection of shoulder-padded pantsuits. She smiles at me and runs her hand under my chin as she passes. &#x201c;You look tired&#x2014;how late were you up last night?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, thanks, Mom.&#x201d; I act offended, adjusting my seat to face her as she moves across the kitchen. &#x201c;I was up all night.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All night? Allison! You know that&#x2019;s not good for you.&#x201d; She is standing in front of the pantry, choosing tonight&#x2019;s dinner. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like it when you do that. You need your rest.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I had a test today&#x2014;what else was I supposed to do? Just fail? Not really an option, Mother.&#x201d;<br> <br>I slump over loudly onto the kitchen table for effect. Cramming my face deep into my arm, I think about the enormous task that lies in my future: showering. It just seems like so much effort. All to drive to Sara&#x2019;s and spend way too much time getting ready for a boy who no longer seems to notice me. With hours between me and the conversation with Sara in the hallway, this football game seems less and less appealing. Are we just going to walk up to the basketball team in the stands like we&#x2019;re part of the gang? Here I am with an hour&#x2019;s worth of makeup and a very padded bra&#x2014;ask me to prom!<br> <br>My mom is humming as she pours spaghetti into a pot of boiling water on the stove. From the dark hideout inside my arms, I hear my cell phone vibrate deep within my overpacked book bag. A pang of annoyance, because I know it&#x2019;s Sara badgering me to hurry up. Come on&#x2014;there won&#x2019;t be any seats left near the b-ball team! Or something mature like You&#x2019;re so slooowww. I don&#x2019;t move to check my phone, just to spite her, but then it buzzes again. Slowly, with individual, methodic, three-inch scoots, I move the chair across the linoleum toward my book bag while my mother casts annoyed looks at me from the other side of the kitchen. I dig around, moving aside binders and loose sheets of paper, and dislodge my cell phone from deep within a bottom corner.<br> <br>Sara:<br> <br>Just heard boys bball team is out of town for tournament so Sam won&#x2019;t be at JV game. Do u still want to go? Want to come over and watch a movie instead?<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t say ur tired.<br> <br>Me:<br> <br>Im tired.<br> <br>Need to do homework and catch up on reading<br> <br>We will do something fun tomorrow night, promise!! xox<br> <br>A wave of relief sweeps over me, and I feel immediately guilty for being annoyed with her. She&#x2019;s just trying to help. Within five seconds, there&#x2019;s another buzz.<br> <br>Sara:<br> <br>Typical Allison. Sleep tight little bookworm!<br> <br>I look up from my phone with a deep sigh. When did we lose the concept of a school night, I wonder, dragging my loaded book bag behind me down the hallway and up the stairs to my room. (&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t take a long shower. I&#x2019;m starting dinner!&#x201d; my mom yells from the kitchen below.) I feel a quick blip of regret that I won&#x2019;t have the chance to sweep my potential future prom date off his feet. What if he meets another girl before I can convince him that he is still infatuated with me? What if Sara gets asked to prom and I don&#x2019;t?<br> <br>After dropping my bag off in the den, I grab my own no-less-embarrassing version of comfy clothes from my room before heading down the hall to my bathroom. As I let the warm water rinse away the remnants of an arduous afternoon, I almost cry with the overwhelming relief that has swept through me at this last-minute change of plans. Of course, in the safety of the hypothetical, I would love the opportunity to woo my way back into Sam&#x2019;s good graces. In my daydreams, I walk toward him in the bleachers, chin high, chest out, and impress him with my wit, charm, and very well-straightened hair. Back in reality, however, I am a hesitant, wobbly colt. A girl who plans out our entire conversation before seeing him and still manages to get stuck on her words. The weirdo who has a list of brainstormed questions memorized and at the ready, in case I ever run into him and need to generate a conversation. (So, how about those Atlanta Braves, right?) I can&#x2019;t be witty or cute or flippant. Not with him! I can&#x2019;t even maintain eye contact for a complete sentence. Of course I want a date to prom, but entertaining a boy at a football game? In front ...</p><h2>The Strong Shall Live: Stories</h2><p>They came west to stay, risking their blood to dig the gold, ride the range, conquer the greedy, and carve out a legacy of freedom. Men honed by desert fires and edged by combat with fist and gun. Women tested to the limit of endurance by an unrelenting land. Now, in a long-awaited collection of his stories, Louis L&#39;Amour tells of the real heroes of the frontier, the survivors for whom hanging tough was as natural as drawing breath.</p><p>Our foremost storyteller of the American West, <b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour </b>has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and woman who settled the frontier. There are more than three hundred million copies of his books in print around the world.THE STRONG SHALL LIVE<br>The land was fire beneath and the sky was brass above, but throughout the day's long riding the bound man sat erect in the saddle and cursed them for thieves and cowards. Their blows did not silence him, although the blood from his swollen and cracked lips had dried on his face and neck.<br><br>Only John Sutton knew where they rode and only he knew what he planned for Cavagan, and John Sutton sat thin and dry and tall on his long-limbed horse, leading the way.<br><br>Nine men in all, tempered to the hard ways of an unforgiving land, men strong in the strengths needed to survive in a land that held no place for the weak or indecisive. Eight men and a prisoner taken after a bitter chase from the pleasant coastal lands to the blazing desert along the Colorado River.<br><br>Cavagan had fought on when the others quit. They destroyed his crops, tore down his fences, and burned his home. They killed his hired hand and tried to kill him. When they burned his home he rebuilt it, and when they shot at him he shot back.<br><br>When they ambushed him and left him for dead, he crawled into the rocks like a wounded grizzly, treated his own wounds, and then caught a horse and rode down to Sutton's Ranch and shot out their lights during the victory celebration.<br><br>Two of Sutton's men quit in protest, for they admired a game man, and Cavagan was winning sympathy around the country.<br><br>Cavagan was a black Irishman from County Sligo. His mother died on the Atlantic crossing and his father was killed by Indians in Tennessee. At sixteen Cavagan fought in the Texas war for independence, trapped in the Rockies for two years, and in the war with Mexico he served with the Texas Rangers and learned the value of a Walker Colt.<br><br>At thirty he was a man honed by desert fires and edged by combat with fist, skull, and pistol. Back in County Sligo the name had been O'Cavagan and the family had a reputation won in battle.<br><br>Sutton's men surrounded his house a second time thinking to catch him asleep. They fired at the house and waited for him to come out. Cavagan had slept on the steep hillside behind the house and from there he opened fire, shooting a man from his saddle and cutting the lobe from Sutton's ear with a bullet intended to kill.<br><br>Now they had him, but he sat straight in the saddle and cursed them. Sutton he cursed but he saved a bit for Beef Hannon, the Sutton foreman.<br><br>"You're a big man, Beef," he taunted, "but untie my hands and I'll pound that thick skull of yours until the yellow runs out of your ears."<br><br>Their eyes squinted against the white glare and the blistering heat from off the dunes, and they tried to ignore him. Among the sand dunes there was no breeze, only the stifling heaviness of hot, motionless air. Wearily their horses plodded along the edge of a dune where the sand fell steeply off into a deep pit among the dunes. John Sutton drew rein. "Untie his feet," he said.<br><br>Juan Velasquez swung down and removed the rawhide thongs from Cavagan's feet, and then stood back, for he knew the manner of man that was Cavagan.<br><br>"Get down," Sutton told Cavagan.<br><br>Cavagan stared his contempt from the slits where his eyes peered through swollen, blackened flesh, then he swung his leg across the saddle, kicked his boot free of the stirrup and dropped to the ground.<br><br>Sutton regarded him for several minutes, savoring his triumph, then he put the flat of his boot against Cavagan's back and pushed. Cavagan staggered, fought for balance, but the sand crumbled beneath him and he fell, tumbling to the bottom of the hollow among the dunes.<br><br>With his hands tied and his body stiff from the beatings he had taken he needed several minutes to get to his feet. When he stood erect he stared up at Sutton. "It is what I would have expected from you," he said.<br><br>Sutton's features stiffened, and he grew white around the mouth. "You're said to be a tough man, Cavagan. I've heard it until I'm sick of it, so I've brought you here to see how much is tough and how much is shanty Irish bluff. I am curious to see how tough you will be without food or water. We're leaving you here."<br><br>Hannon started to protest. He had himself tried to kill Cavagan, but to leave a man to die in the blazing heat of the desert without food or water and with his hands bound . . . a glance at Sutton's face and the words died on his lips.<br><br>"It's sixty miles to water," he managed, at last.<br><br>John Sutton turned in his saddle and measured Hannon with a glance, then deliberately he faced front and started away. Reluctantly, the others followed.<br><br>Juan Velasquez looked down into the pit at Cavagan. He carried a raw wound in his side from a Cavagan bullet, but that pit was seventy feet deep. Slowly, thinking as he did it, Juan unfastened his canteen and was about to toss it to Cavagan when he caught Sutton's eyes on him.<br><br>"Throw it," Sutton suggested, "but if you do you will follow it."<br><br>Juan balanced the canteen on his palm, tempted beyond measure. Sixty miles? With the temperature at one hundred and twenty degrees? Reluctantly, he retied the canteen to his saddle horn. Sutton watched him, smiling his thin smile.<br><br>"I'll remember that, Juan," Cavagan said. "It was a good thought."<br><br>John Sutton turned his square thin shoulders and rode away, the others following. Hannon's shoulders were hunched as if expecting a blow.<br><br>When the last of them had disappeared from sight, Cavagan stood alone at the bottom of the sand pit.<br><br>This was 1850 and even the Indians avoided the sand hills. There was no law west of Santa Fe or east of the coast mountains. Cavagan had settled on land that Sutton considered his, although he had no legal claim to it. Other would-be settlers had been driven off, but Cavagan would not be driven. To make matters worse he courted the girl Sutton had marked for himself.<br><br>Cavagan stood in the bottom of the sand pit, his eyes closed against the glare of the sun on the white sand. He told himself, slowly, harshly, that he would not, he must not die. Aloud he said, "I shall live! I shall see him die!"<br><br>There was a burning fury within him but a caution born of experience. Shade would come first to the west side of the pit, so with his boot he scraped a small pit in the sand. There, several inches below the surface, it was a little cooler. He sat down, his back to the sun, and waited.<br><br>More than seven hours of sunlight remained. To attempt climbing from the pit or even to fight the thongs on his wrists would cause him to perspire profusely and lessen his chances of ultimate survival. From this moment he must be patient, he must think.<br><br>Sweat dripped from his chin, his throat was parched and the sun on his back and shoulders was like the heat from a furnace. An hour passed, and then another. When at last he looked up there was an inch of shadow under the western lip of the pit.<br><br>He studied the way his wrists were bound. His hands had been tied to the pommel, so they were in front of him. He lifted his wrists to his teeth and began ever so gently to work at the rawhide knots. It took nearly an hour, but by the time his wrists were free the shade had reached the bottom of the pit. He coiled the rawhide and slipped it into his pocket.<br><br>The east slope was somewhat less steep, with each step he slid back, but with each he gained a little. Finally he climbed out and stood in the full glare of the setting sun.<br><br>He knew where the nearest water hole lay but knew Sutton would have it guarded. His problem was simple. He had to find water, get out of the desert, then find a horse and weapons. He intended to destroy Sutton as he would destroy a rabid wolf.<br><br>Shadows stretched out from the mountains. To the north the myriad pinnacles of the Chocolate Mountains crowned themselves with gold from the setting sun. He started to walk.<br><br>It was not sixty miles to the nearest water, for Cavagan knew the desert better than Sutton. West of him, but in a direction he dare not chance, lay Sunset Spring. Brackish water, and off the line for him.<br><br>Twenty-five miles to the northwest among the pinnacles of the Chocolates were rock tanks that might contain water. A Cahuilla Indian had told him of the natural reservoir, and upon this feeble chance he rested his life.<br><br>He walked northwest, his chances a thousand to one. He must walk only in the early hours of the morning and after sundown. During the day he must lie in the shade, if he found any, and wait. To walk in the sun without water was to die.<br><br>The sand was heavy and at each step he sank to his ankles. Choosing a distant peak in the Chocolates he pointed himself toward it. When the stars came out he would choose a star above it for a guide. At night landmarks have a way of losing themselves and what was familiar by day becomes strange and unfamiliar in the darkness.<br><br>To reach the vicinity of the rock tanks was one thing, to find them quite another. Near such tanks in the Tinajas Altas men had died of thirst within a few feet of water, unaware of its presence. Such tanks were natural receptacles catching the runoff from infrequent rains, and so shaded, that evaporation was slow. As there was no seepage there was no vegetation to indicate the presence of water.<br><br>The shadows grew long and only a faint afterglow remained in the sky. On his right and before him lay the valley dividing the dunes from the Chocolate Mountains. Now the air was cool and here and there a star appeared. Desert air is thin and does not retain the heat, hence it soon becomes cool, and in the middle of the night, actually cold. These were the hours Cavagan must use.<br><br>If he could not find the tanks, or if there was no water in them, he would die. Cavagan was a man without illusion. His great strength had been sapped by brutal treatment, and he must conserve what strength remained. Locating his peak and a star above it, he walked on. A long time later, descending from the last of the dunes, he took a diagonal course across the valley. Twice he paused to rest, soaking up the coolness. He put a small pebble in his mouth to start the saliva flowing. For a time it helped.<br><br>Walking in heavy sand he had made but two miles an hour, but on the valley floor he moved faster. If he reached the tinajas and they held water he would have achieved one goal. However, he had no way of carrying water and the next water hole was far. Not that one can place reliance on any desert water hole. Often they were used up or had gone dry.<br><br>His battered face throbbed with every step and his head ached. The pinnacles of the Chocolates loomed nearer, but he was not deceived. They were miles away.<br><br>An hour before dawn he entered a wash that came down from the Chocolates. He was dead tired, and his feet moved awkwardly. In eleven hours he had probably traveled no more than twenty-three or -four miles and should be near the tanks. He found a ledge that offered shade and stretched out. He was soon asleep.<br><br>The heat awakened him. His mouth was dry as parchment and he had difficulty in moving his tongue, which seemed awkward and swollen. A glance at the sun told him it was noon or nearly so. According to the Cahuilla he should be within a few yards of water, certainly within a mile or so. In that maze of cliffs, boulders, rock slabs, and arroyos, cluttered with canelike clumps of ocotillo, he would be fortunate to find anything.<br><br>Animals would come to water but many desert creatures lived without it, getting what moisture they needed from succulent plants or cacti. Some insects sought water, and he had noticed bees flying past taking the straight line that usually led to hive or water.<br><br>His throat was raw and his mind wandered. Far off, over the desert he had recently crossed, lay a lovely blue lake, shimmering among the heat waves . . . a mirage.<br><br>Lying down again he waited for dusk. He was sweating no longer and movement was an effort. He had been almost thirty hours without water and in intense heat.<br><br>It was almost dark when he awakened again. Staggering to his feet he started to climb. The coolness refreshed him and gave him new strength. He pushed on, climbing higher. His vision was uncertain and his skull throbbed painfully, but at times he felt an almost delirious gaiety, and then he would scramble up rocks with zest and abandon. Suddenly he sat down. With a shock of piercing clarity he realized he could die.<br><br>He rarely thought of dying, although he knew it was expected of him as of all men, yet it was always somebody else who was dying. Suddenly he realized he had no special dispensation against death and he could die now, within the hour.<br><br>It was faintly gray in the east when he started again. Amazingly, he found the tanks.<br><br>A sheep track directed him. It was a half-sheltered rock tank, but it was dry. Only a faint dusting of sand lay in the bottom.<br><br>A few minutes later, and a little higher up, he found a second tank. It was bone-dry.<br><br>Soon the sun would rise and the heat would return. Cavagan stared at the empty tanks and tried to swallow, but could not. His throat was raw, and where it was not raw it felt like old rubber. His legs started to tremble, but he refused to sit down. He knew if he sat now he might never get up. There was a queerness in him, a strange lightness as if he no longer possessed weight. Through the semi-delirium induced by heat, thirst, and exhaustion there remained a hard core of resolution, the firmness of a course resolved upon and incomplete. If he quit now John Sutton would have won. If he quit now the desert would have defeated him, and the desert was a friendly place to those who knew how to live with it.<br><br>Cunning came to him. To those who knew how to live with it, not against it. No man could fight the desert and live. A man must move with it, give with it, live by its rules. He had done that, so what remained?</p><h2>Higurashi When They Cry: Curse Killing Arc, Vol. 1 - manga (Higurashi, 5)</h2><p>The dark mysteries of HinamizawaVillage unfold anew in the CURSE KILLING ARC! After a short trip to the city, Keiichi Maebara returns to the small mountain hamlet where he is welcomed with a fresh batch of pranks from Satoko and the rest of his school friends. Satoko may be the youngest of the group, but she always puts on the biggest smile. Who knew her upbeat attitude masked a terrible tragedy--a year ago her older brother, her only family, vanished without a trace. Keiichi&#39;s glad to step in and act as her big-brother figure, but he can&#39;t shake the nagging questions about her real brother&#39;s disappearance. Transfer student? Teenage runaway? Or could it be . . . Oyashiro-sama&#39;s curse?</p><p>Ryukishi07 leapt into the spotlight with HIGURASHI NO NAKU KORO NI which was originally conceived as a series of visual novels and later adapted into the popular manga and anime franchise.Hinamizawa may seem like a boring little Japanese village to those who don&#x2019;t know that it carries the curse of the deity Oyashiro-sama. Keiichi, a new resident recently transplanted from the non-cursed metropolis of Tokyo, is still learning just how dangerous the village can be: each year the curse is fulfilled when someone dies at a festival called &#x201c;Cotton Drifting.&#x201d; And one of his friends lost her parents, and possibly her missing brother, to this curse. Despite the undertones of horror and darkness, most of this manga volume is not all that scary. There is some frightening imagery that accompanies the few instances where the creepiness of the theme slips in, but for the most part the story focuses on carefree things like cooking contests and baseball games. While this first volume opens a new Higurashi subseries, there are two others currently available in English (Abducted by Demons Arc and Cotton Drifting Arc) that fans should be steered toward.

Emily L. Thuma traces the making of this anticarceral feminism at the intersections of struggles for racial and economic justice, prisoners&#x2019; and psychiatric patients&#x2019; rights, and gender and sexual liberation.<br> <br> <i>All Our Trials</i> explores the organizing, ideas, and influence of those who placed criminalized and marginalized women at the heart of their antiviolence mobilizations. This activism confronted a "tough on crime" political agenda and clashed with the mainstream women&#x2019;s movement&#x2019;s strategy of resorting to the criminal legal system as a solution to sexual and domestic violence. Drawing on extensive archival research and first-person narratives, Thuma weaves together the stories of mass defense campaigns, prisoner uprisings, broad-based local coalitions, national gatherings, and radical print cultures that cut through prison walls. In the process, she illuminates a crucial chapter in an unfinished struggle&#x2013;&#x2013;one that continues in today&#x2019;s movements against mass incarceration and in support of transformative justice.</p></p><p><b>Emily L. Thuma</b> is an assistant professor of gender and sexuality studies at the University of California, Irvine.<p>"<em>All Our Trials</em>&nbsp;offers us a robust history of late twentieth-century radical feminist antiviolence organizing. Thuma reminds us that the activism of the present is built upon an important legacy of work that traversed movements and prison walls. If we are to build an abolitionist feminist future, we would be wise to pay attention to the antiracist queer feminist politics of these activists. We owe a debt of gratitude to them for paving the way, and to Thuma for chronicling their struggles."--Angela Y. Davis, University of California, Santa Cruz</p><br><br><p>"<em>All Our Trials</em>&nbsp;is a tour de force. It stands among the best books on the history of modern feminist politics and represents one of the most elucidating histories of the US carceral state produced to date. Emily Thuma centers criminalized women&#x2019;s ideas and organizing, providing graceful historical analysis that will undoubtedly influence current conversations about imprisonment, gender, and sexual violence. This history opens a fiercely urgent path toward an anticarceral feminist future."--Sarah Haley, author of&nbsp;<em>No Mercy Here: Gender, Punishment, and the Making of Jim Crow Modernity</em></p><br><br><p>"With deep compassion, Thuma offers one of the most compelling historical analyses of how feminist activism of Black, queer, and criminalized women has worked to resist the long and dangerous reach of the carceral state. All Our Trials is an important text in the growing fields of critical prison studies and anti-carceral feminism and a critical addition to activist reading lists."--Beth E. Richie, author of Arrested Justice: Black Women, Violence, and America's Prison Nation</p><br><br><p>"<em>All Our Trials</em>&nbsp;transforms our understanding of both the history of feminism and of the carceral state. In her deeply compelling account, Thuma documents the work of activists who centered the lives of the most marginalized in their social justice imaginary and their political agenda, producing an anticarceral feminist politics and an expansive analysis of the interconnections between interpersonal and state violence. A crucial and timely read as we wrestle with gender, race, and violence today."--Regina Kunzel, author of&nbsp;<em>Criminal Intimacy: Prison and the Uneven History of Modern American Sexuality</em></p></p><h2>The Soccer Fence: A story of friendship, hope, and apartheid in South Africa</h2><p><i>In a country struggling with acceptance, hope can come in many different forms.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>As a boy, Hector loved playing soccer in his small Johannesburg township. He dreamed of playing on a real pitch with the boys from another part of the city, but apartheid made that impossible. Then, in 1990, Nelson Mandela was released from prison, and apartheid began to crumble. The march toward freedom in South Africa was a slow one, but when the beloved Bafana Bafana national soccer team won the African Cup of Nations, Hector realized that dreams once impossible could now come true.<br>&nbsp;<br>This poignant story of friendship artfully depicts a brief but critical moment in South Africa&#x2019;s history and the unique role that sports can play in bringing people together.</p><p>An avid soccer fan, Phil Bildner has sat on the Real Madrid bench at el Estadio de Santiago Bernab�u, and he has watched from the bleachers as Lionel Messi scored a hat trick during an Argentina-Brazil showdown. Away from the pitch, Phil was an attorney and taught middle school in the New York City public schools. He is the author of the Texas Bluebonnet Award&#x2013;winning <i>Shoeless Joe &amp; Black Betsy</i>, and the co-author with Loren Long of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Sluggers series.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Jesse Joshua Watson has traveled extensively, developing a deep passion for sharing the beauty of the world&#x2019;s cultures. He has always cared deeply about South Africa&#x2014;in high school he campaigned for Nelson Mandela&#x2019;s freedom by organizing awareness and student action. In addition to writing and illustrating books and teaching art to kids, Jesse plays soccer religiously. He lives in Port Townsend, Washington, with his wife and their sons.Gr 1&#x2013;3&#x2014;Apartheid has ended in South Africa, but a young boy learns that change takes time in this story of friendship and of a nation healing. Hector plays soccer with his sister in the barren field in his township in Johannesburg. What he really wants is to play with the white boys on the lush green field he sees when his mother takes him to the other part of the city where she works, but they never acknowledge the black boy. Newspaper headlines give a history of South Africa from the announcement that apartheid is over to President Mandela being elected (with Hector's family allowed to vote) to South Africa's hosting the 1996 African Cup of Nations. Each historic step is paralleled by the boys' soccer games in their individual neighborhoods as they root for their South African team, Bafana Bafana, throughout the tournament. When their team makes the finals, both boys attend the game and recognize each other from years of watching from the other side of the fence and raise fists in acknowledgement as they lead the procession of cheering fans in a symbolic uniting of a divided country. Bright acrylic paints and broad pencil strokes bring the characters to life while Bildner's first-person narrative personalizes Hector's childhood during these momentous events. Historical notes provide more detail in this effective introduction to apartheid and Nelson Mandela in a tender tribute to which young readers will be able to relate.&#x2014;Kristine M.

This work is a case study on how the B-58 supersonic bomber came to a premature death in the U.S. military, largely because of infighting among military and civilian leaders, who failed to understand the value of this fantastic airplane. It was a technological marvel for its time and the very best pilots and navigators were chosen to fly this unique aircraft. At its maximum speed of 2.2 Mach (1,452 mph) it was 2� times faster than the muzzle velocity of a .45 caliber bullet. It could fly faster and out turn must fighters of its day and was also capable of flying close to tree top level just below the speed of sound. It was nearly undetectable by enemy radars due to its speed and low radar cross section and was better at flying through heavy turbulence due to its solid delta wing design. It had a highly accurate navigation and bombing system. It had a capsule ejection system for the safety of the aircrew and was capable of getting airborne in only half the time required by other bombers. Told for the first time, this is the inside story that dispels the unproven myths surrounding the demise of the B-58 and why this magnificent airplane should have been saved. Its loss from the nuclear armory was a severe blow to our &#x201c;Cold War&#x201d; deterrence strength. The B-58 was a bomber that set the standard for fear in the heart of an enemy. Its loss was a strategic mistake. The author provides lessons learned and recommendations for military and civilian leaders, going forward, to hopefully prevent future blunders&#x2014;like what happened to the B-58.</p><p>The author had a thirty-one year career in the US Air Force, including three years as a navigator/bombardier in the B-58. He worked in the Pentagon; was twice a Wing Commander; as well as a Director at the National War College.

After surviving a near fatal, head-on collision in his last year of college he moved to Friendship, Indiana the home of the National Muzzleloading Rifle Association and began to pursue building black-powder rifles.<br>Friendship, Indiana, is also home of gun maker Jack Haugh who gave Dave the inspiration for quality gun making.<br>Dave's quest brought him to work as a stockmaker at the renowned firm of Griffin &amp; Howe. In the early 1980's, he began to make fine custom riflestocks and accessories on a professional level and achieved recognition nationally with commissioned works by the Dallas Safari Club and others.<br>To create suitable images of his work, Mr. Wesbrook went on to study photography under one of America's most important innovators of fine art photography, Mr. Frederick Sommer. Dave's gun photography has graced the pages of Rifle Magazine, Gun Digest, Peterson's Hunting, Hunters Quest, Guns and American Rifleman. His photographic work has included private collections, special projects for National Geographic, National Gallery of Art, National Museum of American History, The Smithsonian Institute, as well as all photographic illustration in this book.<br>Today Mr. Wesbrook resides in the Midwest and continues to produce custom rifles, hunt, fish and do fine art photography.</p><h2>Fever-Tree: The Art of Mixing: Recipes from the world&#39;s leading bars</h2><p><br><b>'The best tonic on the planet' - Ashton Kutcher</b><br><br>The first cocktail title to put the mixers center-stage. Rather than starting with the spirits, this book focuses on key mixers - including tonic, lemonade, ginger ale, ginger beer and cola - and provide 100 classic and contemporary cocktail recipes that make the most of the botanical partnerships.<br><br>The book also explores the origins of key ingredients, including quinine, lemons and elderflower, revealing the role quinine has played in geo-politics, for example, and the impact different herbs have on taste.

The business is founded on a simple premise: to restore taste to mixers by using the highest quality natural ingredients.<br><br>Following a "tonic tasting" in the US market, Charles Rolls - who built his reputation running Plymouth Gin - joined forces with Tim Warrillow, who had a background in luxury food marketing, to analyse the composition of mixers. They discovered that the majority of mixers are preserved with sodium benzoate or similar substances, while cheap orange aromatics such as decanal and artificial sweeteners (such as saccharin) are widespread.<br><br>And so started a 15-month journey, with days of research at the British Library into quinine sources from as far back as 1620 and many trips to find the purest strains of this key ingredient. Five iterations of the recipe were tasted before Charles and Tim were happy with the result and the first bottle of Fever-Tree Indian Tonic Water was produced in 2005. Fever-Tree mixers are now exported to more than 50 countries and in the UK and US they are sold in several leading supermarkets, as well as bars and restaurants worldwide. Continually recognised for the quality of their products, the brand has won numerous awards in the UK, US, Europe and even as far as Australia, including six Taste awards, the Queen's Award for Excellence, several Grocer Gold Awards and Best New Product at Tales of the Cocktail.<br>'If three-quarters of your G&amp;T is the tonic, make sure you use the best.'&#x2015;<b>Tim Warrillow, co-founder of Fever-Tree</b><br><br>'The best tonic on the planet'&#x2015;<b>Ashton Kutcher</b><br><br>'The Ultimate G&amp;T'&#x2015;<b>Jamie Oliver</b><br><br>'Fever-Tree is an outstanding mixer'&#x2015;<b>Ferran Adria</b></p><h2>RuneScape: Return to Canifis</h2><p><p>Varrock is the greatest human city in the world, yet it is filled with dangerous secrets.

Extensive interviews with people who knew Montgomery &#x2013; her son, maids, friends, relatives, all now deceased &#x2013; are only part of the material gathered in a journey to understand Montgomery that took Rubio to Poland and the highlands of Scotland. <br><br>From Montgomery&#x2019;s apparently idyllic childhood in Prince Edward Island to her passion-filled adolescence and young adulthood, to her legal fights as world-famous author, to her shattering experiences with motherhood and as wife to a deeply troubled man, this fascinating, intimate narrative of her life will engage and delight.</p><p>Mary Henley Rubio is University Professor Emeritus at the University of Guelph. She co-edited <b>The Selected Journals of L.M. Montgomery</b> (five volumes, 1985-2004), co-authored <b>Writing a Life: L.M. Montgomery</b>, and edited <b>Harvesting Thistles: The Textual Garden of L.M. Montgomery</b>. Her most recent book is the <b>Norton Critical Edition of Anne of Green Gables</b>.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>In November 1907, Lucy Maud Montgomery wrote to a friend that biography is a &#x201c;<i>screaming farce</i>.&#x201d; She added that the best biographies give only two-dimensional portraits, but every person has a half dozen &#x201c;different sides.&#x201d; In 2008, one hundred years after the publication of <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, we know much more about the many sides of &#x201c;Maud,&#x201d; as she liked to be called. And in fact many now feel that Maud&#x2019;s greatest literary creation was her own tortured self�portrait, now published in her private journals more than fifty years after her death. But the truth may be even more complicated than that.<br><br>Maud&#x2019;s life feels at times like a smoke-and-mirrors game. By 1920, when her name was famous all over the English-speaking world, Maud began preparing material for those who would later interpret her life. She compiled scrapbooks, account books, review-clipping books, and a multitude of other memorabilia. Although she was (in her son&#x2019;s words) a &#x201c;packrat&#x201d; by nature, this material was also intended as a cache of information for those who would later become her biographers. She carefully recopied her journals, starting in 1919, making an edited, permanent copy. <i>She</i> saw her journals as her greatest gift to future biographers: they presented her life as <i>she</i> wanted it remembered.<br><br>When Elizabeth Waterston and I began editing the L. M. Montgomery journals in the 1980s, we took them at face value. Later we came to question elements in these fascinating life�documents. They did not hold <i>the</i> truth, we felt, so much as <i>a</i> truth. These journals, frank in so many ways, and so rich as social history, began to seem to us a cache of concealments, displacements, contradictions, and omissions. Initially, they seemed such a boon, but eventually they became another layer to excavate through. This biography will track some of my own processes, as well as my conclusions. In the nearly three decades that she has been the object of my part�time research I have never grown bored with Maud. She is truly a biographer&#x2019;s dream subject: you never feel that you have found the master key that <i>fully</i> unlocks all the rooms in her house.<br>In 1908, Lucy Maud Montgomery burst onto the literary scene with her first novel, <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>. At age thirty�three, she had already published scores of short stories and poems, but this best�selling novel achieved instant acclaim, with seven impressions printed in its first year alone. It churned up so much attention that her home province, Prince Edward Island, soon had a flood of visitors, all wanting to see the landscapes she painted so vividly. Her publisher demanded sequels, and she obliged, eventually making her beloved Island a site for tourists from all over the world. Her books appeared to be &#x201c;simple little tales&#x201d; (to echo her own modest phrasing in a journal entry dated October 15, 1908), but that was misleading: the last quarter century of scholarly research has shown that her writing has been, in fact, a very powerful agent of social change.<br><br><i>Anne of Green Gables</i> was not written as a novel for children. It was aimed at a general audience of adults and children, men and women, sophisticates and simple readers, as were many of her other books. It appealed to famous statesmen as much as to ordinary people. In 1908, the celebrated author Mark Twain wrote Maud to praise &#x201c;Anne&#x201d; as &#x201c;the dearest and most moving and delightful child since the immortal Alice.&#x201d; In 1910, Earl Grey, one of Canada&#x2019;s most beloved Governors General and an esteemed writer himself, travelled to Prince Edward Island just to meet her. In 1923, she was the first Canadian woman to be elected as a member of the British Royal Society of Arts.<br><br>By 1925, translations into other languages were expanding her readership in Sweden, Holland, Poland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Australia, and France. Two prime ministers of Great Britain expressed admiration for her books: Stanley Baldwin made a point of meeting her during his 1927 tour of Canada; his successor, Ramsay MacDonald, is reported to have said that he read all of her books that he could find &#x2013; not just once, but several times.<br><br>At home in Ontario, where she moved in 1911 following her marriage to Presbyterian minister Ewan Macdonald, Maud was in constant demand as a storyteller and speaker. She was also active in organizations associated with the Canadian cultural scene, particularly the Canadian Authors Association. In 1928, a rapturous audience of two thousand gave her a standing ovation at the annual Canadian Book Week in Toronto, Ontario. In 1935, she was elected to the Literary and Artistic Institute of France for her contributions to literature. In the same year, she was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in Canada. In 1937, the Montreal <i>Family Herald and Star</i> reported from a survey that she and Charles Dickens were the &#x201c;most read&#x201d; authors in Canada. Also in 1937, the Prince Edward Island National Park was established to preserve the landscapes her books had made so famous. Her status as an international celebrity seemed secure.<br><br>By the time of her death in 1942, she had published over twenty books, and more than five hundred short stories and five hundred poems, all while raising a family, living a busy life as the wife of a country minister, and completing ten volumes of secret journals. Her books were read all over the English-speaking world, and were translated into many more languages. No other Canadian writer had reached such a pinnacle of success on so many fronts: she was truly an international celebrity.<br><br>But a reversal of her literary reputation had been slowly occurring. For the first decade after <i>Anne of Green Gables </i>was published, critics praised Maud&#x2019;s books. However, as Modernism set in, with its grim focus on the breakdown of social norms, critics dimmed their view of her cheerful books, with their witty treatment of human behaviour and their celebration of the imagination and nature. Instead, the professional critics started faulting her novels for their splashes of purple prose and their &#x201c;sentimentalism,&#x201d; ignoring the darker soundings that haunted her stories before the reader got to the &#x201c;happy endings.&#x201d;<br><br>In the mid-1920s, the growing cadre of men who panned her books included influential newsmen, university professors, and writers in Canada, and they all knew each other. In 1926, one of Canada&#x2019;s powerful newspaper critics led the attack, labelling her books the nadir of Canadian fiction. A much respected professor of literature termed her books &#x201c;na�ve&#x201d; with an &#x201c;innocence&#x201d; that suggested &#x201c;ignorance of life.&#x201d; A grudging evaluation was made by another male novelist, who wrote: &#x201c; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not that those books may not have their readers who profit from them: I have found that out. But how a woman who judges so accurately can stand <i>writing</i> that stuff .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; In the face of such attacks, even the critics who had previously lauded her writing started being careful to temper their praise.<br><br>Nevertheless, all these men were impressed (and annoyed) by her sales success. While some allowed that her large readership <i>might</i> speak to some undefined cultural need, others felt that her popularity merely proved her &#x201c;lowbrow&#x201d; quality. These detractors spoke with such a powerful voice in Canada between the mid-1920s and her death in 1942 that her work fell into disfavour. Librarians heeded what the influential critics said, and some libraries even shunned her books. In 1967, the don of Canadian librarians, Sheila Egoff, wrote a groundbreaking study of Canadian children&#x2019;s literature that gave definition to the field. She repeated the view of the earlier critics, and attacked Maud for &#x201c;sentimental dishonesty.&#x201d; By the 1970s the general wisdom was that Montgomery was a sentimental writer who appealed to the uncultured and masses of undiscriminating women and children, and still in the 1980s, expressing an admiration for Maud&#x2019;s books was rather risky. She was relegated strictly to the category of &#x201c;children&#x2019;s writer,&#x201d; and was judged by her weakest books, not by her best.<br>My thinking for this biography began in summer 1974. At that time, I was a young academic attending an international children&#x2019;s literature conference in Toronto, which brought together librarians, academics, and writers from North America and the United Kingdom. I was surprised to hear several Canadians there refer to Maud&#x2019;s writing in terms that depicted it as a national embarrassment. That, I learned, was the legacy of the critics of the previous fifty years: their view was entrenched.<br><br>This puzzled me. I had come from the United States and a background in American literature. I taught Mark Twain&#x2019;s <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> at the University of Guelph. In my view, <i>Anne of Green Gables</i> held up very well in comparison. The main difference was that Huck, a boy, could challenge conventions, but Anne, a girl, had to conform to them. Otherwise, there were many interesting similarities between the two books. Each author had a wonderfully comic way with satire, and each book &#x2013; though telling a simple, episodic story &#x2013; had a great deal of depth.<br><br>I soon discovered that one of my senior colleagues, Elizabeth Waterston, believed that Maud was undervalued, too. In 1967 &#x2013; Canada&#x2019;s centennial year and the year Sheila Egoff&#x2019;s book was published &#x2013; Elizabeth had written the first substantial scholarly article taking Maud&#x2019;s books seriously. Soon after, she had been quietly advised by a distinguished university colleague not to waste any more time writing about Maud if she wished to advance up the academic ladder. He meant the advice in a kindly way, fearing that her critical talents would be squandered on an unworthy subject &#x2013; at least in the eyes of the English Department&#x2019;s Promotion and Tenure Committee.<br><br>By 1974, Elizabeth had moved on, and had become Chair of the Department of English at the University of Guelph. In 1975, a group of us in the department decided to start the journal <i>CCL: Canadian Children&#x2019;s Literature</i>. (We had already started a course in &#x201c;Children&#x2019;s Literature,&#x201d; a new academic field then.) Maud became the focus of our third issue, with Elizabeth&#x2019;s 1967 piece reprinted as the lead article. We were scrabbling for material in a new field, and I set about writing a comparison of <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> and <i>Anne</i>. Writing this article intensified my interest in Maud. I didn&#x2019;t like the sequels as much as I liked <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, but there was something magnetic about her writing.<br><br>This ultimately led to a long journey into literary archaeology. In the late 1970s I met Maud&#x2019;s son, Dr. E. Stuart Macdonald (who, as our friendship developed, I came to call &#x201c;Stuart&#x201d;), after sending him a complimentary copy of our special issue. By this time, I had formed an image of the personality I believed to be behind Maud&#x2019;s books: she had a wonderful sense of humour and she looked at humankind with a bemused, tolerant smile. I thought she must have been the ideal mother, and said so early in my first meeting with her son. That ill�advised remark clearly hit a nerve, and I will never forget Dr. Macdonald&#x2019;s slow, appraising look, first <i>at</i> me and then <i>into</i> me and finally <i>through</i> me. A succinct (and more measured) version of his response to me is found in a letter he once wrote to a Swedish woman:<br><br><i>. . . although in her writings, [my mother] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gave the impression of broad tolerance of human weaknesses, she did not condone any such elasticity in herself or her family. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She was extremely sensitive, although an excellent dissembler, and though she experienced great peaks, she also fell to great depths emotionally, which does not make for tranquillity. This rigidity and sensitivity, prevented any easy camaraderie in the family, but she was capable of inspiring deep affection in us all.</i><br><br>By the end of the interview, I was rather intimidated by Maud&#x2019;s son, a busy and respected medical doctor who knew how to speak his mind forcefully when journalists and academics intruded on his time. But my curiosity about his mother&#x2019;s personality was piqued to the extreme. Where did those funny, happy novels come from?<br><br>Dr. Macdonald died suddenly of an aneurysm in 1982, and Elizabeth Waterston and I began the long process of editing Maud&#x2019;s journals together. Maud had willed them to Dr. Macdonald with the instruction that he should publish them eventually. I expected them to answer my evolving fascination with Maud&#x2019;s hold on people &#x2013; including me. A friend working on a Ph.D. told me her theory: &#x201c;I reread Montgomery to wash the academic sludge out of my mind.&#x201d; Other&#x2019;s comments confirmed that reading Maud&#x2019;s books seemed to make people feel happy, refreshed, and part of a special community. I mused over the possibility of measuring happiness through people&#x2019;s neural responses while reading different writers, and I fancied the fun in matching Maud against a Faulkner or a Joyce.<br><br>As Elizabeth and I went through the journals together, editing them, we puzzled over the astonishing disjunction between the bright, happy novels and the dark, often painful life. How could one personality produce such different documents simultaneously &#x2013; writing cheerful novels in the morning and tortured journals in the evening, so to speak? Maud was quite aware of her own bifurcated life. As a minister&#x2019;s wife with a very judgmental nature, she developed a carefully controlled public persona and revealed little of her inner thoughts. Her journals were clearly a safety valve for a highly volatile woman. What was this complex woman really like?<br><br>Once, when a journalist came to interview her, she wrote that she was keeping her inner life private and hidden: &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll give him the bare facts he wants. He will not know any more about the real me or my real life for it all. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The only key to <i>that</i> is found in this old journal.&#x201d; But as Elizabeth and I worked closely with the journals, those &#x201c;tell-all&#x201d; documents, we discovered they did <i>not</i> reveal everything.<br><br>Dr. Macdonald had asked me to write a biography of his mother based on her journals shortly before he died. I argued that the proper order was to publish the journals first, and then write a biography, after more research. Elizabeth and I wrote a short biography called <i>Writing a Life: L. M. Montgomery</i> in 1995, and it is now available on the Internet (www.lmmrc.ca). Dr. Macdonald told me that if I did write his mother&#x2019;s biography, he wanted it to be as truthful as possible for several reasons: first, because she herself hated prettied-up biographies that made no attempt to get behind the real truths in lives; second, because her achievements would be more remarkable if people knew the conditions under which she wrote; and finally, because there would be things people could learn from her life that might prevent them from making the same mistakes. His mother had left him written instructions that he was to publish all of her journals intact, eventually, but there is much in this biography that is not in her journals and that he himself did not know.</p><h2>The Story of Peter Pan: Unabridged in Easy-To-Read Type (Dover Children&#39;s Thrift Classics)</h2><p>The humor, whimsy, and high adventure of James M. Barrie's play <i>Peter Pan</i> have delighted generations of children and adults and continue to inspire new entertainments based on the original drama. Among the first of these highly successful adaptations was the version (written by Barrie himself) created by Daniel O'Connor shortly after the play's enthusiastically acclaimed first London production in December of 1904. Enhanced by over 40 illustrations that perfectly capture the fanciful turns of mood and plot, <i>The Story of Peter Pan</i> is a delightful retelling of the story that has been a bedtime favorite of children for nearly a century. It is reprinted here, complete with musical selections (vocal and piano) from the original stage production, to once again delight young fans of Peter, Wendy, and all the denizens of the Darling household and the Never-Never-Never Land.</p><p><p>J.

Nothing much has changed in the dollhouse during that time, except for the fact that 45 years ago, Annabelle's Auntie Sarah disappeared from the dollhouse without a trace. After all this time, restless Annabelle is becoming more and more curious about her aunt's fate. And when she discovers Auntie Sarah's old diary, she becomes positively driven. Her cautious family tries to discourage her, but Annabelle won't be stopped, even though she risks Permanent Doll State, in which she could turn into a regular, nonliving doll. And when the "Real Pink Plastic" Funcraft family moves in next door, the Doll family's world is turned upside down--in more ways than one!<p> Fans of <i>The Borrowers</i> and <i>Stuart Little</i> will love this exciting story of adventure and mystery. The relationship between the two doll families, one antique, one modern, is hilariously, wonderfully drawn. The Funcrafts are reckless and raucous, with fearlessness born of their unbreakable plastic parts. The Doll family is reserved and somewhat prim, even though they occasionally break into '60s tunes like "Respect" in their sing-alongs. Annabelle is a heroine with integrity and gumption.

I don't remember how old I was then, but I must have been very young. This was in the early days, when we still went on family outings. We were walking along the boardwalk when we ran into the four Chinese men. My mother told the story often, as if she thought we'd forgotten. "You kids didn't know them and neither did I. They were friends of your father's, from Chinatown. You'd never heard Chinese before. You didn't know what was up. You stood there with your mouths hanging open--I had to laugh. 'Why are they singing? Why is Daddy singing?'" One of the men gave each of my sisters and me a dollar bill. I cashed mine into dimes and set out to win a goldfish. A dime bought you three chances to toss a Ping-Pong ball into one of many small fishbowls, each holding a quivering tangerine-colored fish. Overexcited, I threw recklessly, again and again. When all the dimes were gone I ran back to the grown-ups in tears. The man who had given me the dollar tried to give me another, but my parents wouldn't allow it.He pressed the bag of peanuts he had been eating into my hands and said I could have them all. I never saw any of those men again or heard anything about them. They were the only friends of my father's that I would ever meet. I would hear him speak Chinese again, but very seldom. In Chinese restaurants, occasionally on the telephone, once or twice in his sleep, and in the hospital when he was dying. So it was true, then. He really was Chinese. Up until that day I had not quite believed it. &nbsp; <br> My mother always said that he had sailed to America on a boat. He took a slow boat from China, was what she used to say, laughing. I wasn't sure whether she was serious, and if she was, why coming from China was such a funny thing. A slow boat from China. In time I learned that he was born not in China but in Panama. No wonder I only half-believed he was Chinese. He was only half-Chinese. &nbsp; <br> The facts I know about his life are unbearably few. Although we shared the same house for eighteen years, we had little else in common. We had no culture in common. It is only a slight exaggeration to say that we had no language in common. By the time I was born my father had lived almost thirty years in America, but to hear him speak you would not have believed this. About his failure to master English there always seemed to me something willful. Except for her accent--as thick as but so different from his--my mother had no such trouble. "He never would talk about himself much, you know.That was his way. He never really had much to say, in general. Silence was golden. It was a cultural thing, I think." (My mother.) By the time I was old enough to understand this, my father had pretty much stopped talking. Taciturnity: They say that is an Oriental trait. But I don't believe my father was always the silent, withdrawn man I knew. Think of that day at Coney Island, when he was talking a Chinese blue streak. Almost everything I know about him came from my mother, and there was much she herself never knew, much she had forgotten or was unsure of, and much she would never tell. &nbsp; <br> I am six, seven, eight years old, a schoolgirl with deplorable posture and constantly cracked lips, chafing in the dollish Old World clothes handmade by my mother; a bossy, fretful, sly, cowardly child given to fits of temper and weeping. In school, or in the playground, or perhaps watching television, I hear something about the Chinese--something odd, improbable. I will ask my father. He will know whether it is true, say, that the Chinese eat with sticks. He shrugs. He pretends not to understand. Or he scowls and says, "Chinese just like everybody else." ("He thought you were making fun of him. He always thought everyone was making fun of him. He had a chip on his shoulder. The way he acted, you'd've thought he was colored!") Actually, he said "evvybody." Is it true the Chinese write backwards? Chinese just like evvybody else. Is it true they eat dog? Chinese just like evvybody else. Are they really all Communists? Chinese just like evvybody else. What is Chinese water torture? What is foot-binding? What is a mandarin? Chinese just like evvybody else. He was not like everybody else. &nbsp; <br> The unbearably few facts are these. He was born in Colon, Panama, in 1911. His father came from Shanghai. From what I have been able to gather, Grandfather Chang was a merchant engaged in the trade of tobacco and tea. This business, which he ran with one of his brothers, kept him traveling often between Shanghai and Col <i></i>n. He had two wives, one in each city, and, as if out of a passion for symmetry, two sons by each wife. Soon after my father, Carlos, was born, his father took him to Shanghai, to be raised by the Chinese wife. Ten years later my father was sent back to Col <i></i>n. I never understood the reason for this. The way the story was told to me, I got the impression that my father was being sent away from some danger. This was, of course, a time of upheaval in China, the decade following the birth of the Republic, the era of the warlords. If the date is correct, my father would have left Shanghai the year the Chinese Communist party was founded there. It remains uncertain, though, whether political events had anything at all to do with his leaving China. One year after my father returned to Colon his motherwas dead. I remember hearing as a child that she had died of a stroke. Years later this would seem to me odd, when I figured out that she would have been only twenty-six. Odder still, to think of that reunion between the longparted mother and son; there's a good chance they did not speak the same language. The other half-Panamanian son, Alfonso, was either sent back with my father or had never left Col <i></i>n. After their mother's death the two boys came into the care of their father's brother and business partner, Uncle Mee, who apparently lived in Col <i></i>n and had a large family of his own. Grandfather Chang, his Chinese wife, and their two sons remained in Shanghai. All were said to have been killed by the Japanese. That must have been during the Sino-Japanese War. My father would have been between his late twenties and early thirties by then, but whether he ever saw any of those Shanghai relations again before they died, I don't know. At twelve or thirteen my father sailed to America with Uncle Mee. I believe it was just the two of them who came, leaving the rest of the family in Col <i></i>n. Sometime in the next year or so my father was enrolled in a public school in Brooklyn. I remember coming across a notebook that had belonged to him in those days and being jolted by the name written on the cover: Charles Cipriano Chang. That was neither my father's first nor his last name, as far as I knew, and I'd never heard of the middle name. (Hard to believe that my father spent his boyhood in Shanghai being called Carlos, a name he could not even pronounce with the proper Spanish accent. So he must have had a Chinese name as well. And although our family never knewthis name, perhaps among Chinese people he used it.) Twenty years passed. All I know about this part of my father's life is that it was lived illegally in New York, mostly in Chinatown, where he worked in various restaurants. Then came the Second World War and he was drafted. It was while he was in the army that he finally became an American citizen. He was no longer calling himself Charles but Carlos again, and now, upon becoming a citizen, he dropped his father's family name and took his mother's. Why a man who thought of himself as Chinese, who had always lived among Chinese, who spoke little Spanish, and who had barely known his mother would have made such a decision in the middle of his life is one of many mysteries surrounding my father. My mother had an explanation. "You see, Alfonso was a Panamanian citizen, and <i>he</i> had taken his mother's name" (which would, of course, be in keeping with Spanish cultural tradition). "He was the only member of his family your father had left--the others were all dead. Your father wanted to have the same last name as his brother. Also, he thought he'd get along better in this country with a Spanish name." This makes no sense to me. He'd been a Chinatown Chang for twenty years. Now all of a sudden he wished to pass for Hispanic? In another version of this story, the idea of getting rid of the Chinese name was attributed to the citizenship official handling my father's papers. This is plausible, given that immigration restrictions for Chinese were still in effect at that time. But I have not ruled out the possibility that the change of names was the result of a misunderstanding between my father and this official. My fatherwas an easily fuddled man, especially when dealing with authority, and he always had trouble understanding and making himself understood in English. And I can imagine him not only befuddled enough to make such a mistake but also too timid afterward to try to fix it. Whatever really happened I'm sure I'll never know. I do know that having a Spanish name brought much confusion into my father's life and have always wondered in what way my own life might have been different had he kept the name Chang. &nbsp; <br> From this point on the story becomes somewhat clearer. With the Hundredth Infantry Division my father goes to war, fights in France and Germany, and, after V-E Day, is stationed in the small southern German town where he will meet my mother. He is thirty-four and she has just turned eighteen. She is soon pregnant. Here is rich food for speculation: How did they communicate? She had had a little English in school. He learned a bit of German. They must have misunderstood far more than they understood of each other. Perhaps this helps to explain why my eldest sister was already two and my other sister on the way before my parents got married. (My sisters and I did not learn about this until we were in our twenties.) By the time I was three they would already have had two long separations. "I should have married Rudolf!" (My mother.) Nineteen forty-eight. My father returns to the States with his wife and first daughter. Now everything is drastically changed. A different America this: the America of thecitizen, the legal worker, the family man. No more drinking and gambling till all hours in Chinatown. No more drifting from job to job, living hand to mouth, sleeping on the floor of a friend's room or on a shelf in the restaurant kitchen. There are new, undreamed-of expenses: household money, layettes, taxes, insurance, a special bank account for the children's education. He does the best he can. He rents an apartment in the Fort Greene housing project, a short walk from the Cantonese restaurant on Fulton Street where he works as a waiter. Some nights after closing, after all the tables have been cleared and the dishes done, he stays for the gambling. He weaves home to a wide-awake wife who sniffs the whiskey on his breath and doesn't care whether he has lost or won. So little money--to gamble with any of it is a sin. Her English is getting better ("no thanks to him!"), but for what she has to say she needs little vocabulary. She is miserable. She hates America. She dreams incessantly about going home. There is something peculiar about the three-year-old: She rarely smiles; she claws at the pages of magazines, like a cat. The one-year-old is prone to colic. To her horror my mother learns that she is pregnant again. She attempts an abortion, which fails. I am born. About that attempt, was my father consulted? Most likely not. Had he been I think I know what he would have said. He would have said: No, this time it will be a boy. Like most men he would have wanted a son. (All girls--a house full of females--a Chinese man's nightmare!) Perhaps with a son he would have been more open. Perhaps a son he would have taught Chinese. He gets another job, as a dishwasher in the kitchen of a large public health service hospital. He will work thereuntil he retires, eventually being promoted to kitchen supervisor. He moves his family to another housing project, outside the city, newly built, cleaner, safer. He works all the time. On weekends, when he is off from the hospital, he waits on tables in one or another Chinese restaurant. He works most holidays and takes no vacation. On his rare day off he outrages my mother by going to the racetrack. But he is not self-indulgent. A little gambling, a quart of Budweiser with his supper--eaten alone, an hour or so after the rest of us (he always worked late)--now and then a glass of Scotch, cigarettes--these were his only pleasures. While the children are still small there are occasional outings. To Coney Island, Chinatown, the zoo. On Sundays sometimes he takes us to the children's matinee, and once a year to Radio City, for the Christmas or Easter show. But he and my mother never go out alone together, just the two of them--never. Her English keeps getting better, making his seem worse and worse. He is hardly home, yet my memory is of constant fighting. Not much vocabulary needed to wound. "Stupid woman. Crazy lady. Talk, talk, talk, talk--never say nothing!" "I should have married Rudolf!" Once, she spat in his face. Another time, she picked up a bread knife and he had to struggle to get it away from her. They slept in separate beds. Every few months she announced to the children that itwas over: We were going "home." (And she did go back with us to Germany once, when I was two. We stayed six months. About this episode she was always vague. In years to come, whenever we asked her why we did not stay in Germany, she would say, "You children wanted your father." But I think that is untrue. More likely she realized that there was no life for her back there. She had never gotten on well with her family. By this time I believe Rudolf had married another.) Even working the two jobs, my father did not make much money. He would never make enough to buy a house. Yet it seemed the burden of being poor weighed heavier on my mother. Being poor meant you could never relax, meant eternal attention to appearances. Just because you had no money didn't mean you were squalid. Come into the house: See how clean and tidy everything is. Look at the children: spotless. And people did comment to my mother--on the shininess of her floors and how she kept her children--and she was gratified by this. Still, being poor was exhausting. One day a woman waist-deep in children knocked at the door. When my mother answered, the woman apologized. "I thought--from the name on the mailbox I thought you were Spanish too. My kids needed to use the toilet." My mother could not hide her displeasure. She was proud of being German, and in those postwar years she was also bitterly defensive. When people called us names--spicks and chinks--she said, "You see how it is in this country. For all they say how bad we Germans are, no one ever calls you names for being German." She had no patience with my father's quirks. The involuntarytwitching of a muscle meant that someone had given him the evil eye. Drinking a glass of boiled water while it was still hot cured the flu. He saved back issues of <i>Reader's Digest</i> and silver dollars from certain years, believing that one day they'd be worth a lot of money. What sort of backward creature had she married? His English drove her mad. Whenever he didn't catch something that was said to him (...</p><h2>Until the End: The Party; The Dance; The Graduation</h2><p>It&#x2019;s the start of the school year, and the popular girls have decided to throw the best party, one their friends will never forget.

Spence reconstructs an extraordinary episode in the early intercourse between Europe and China. It is the story of John Hu, a lowly but devout Chinese Catholic, who in 1722 accompanied a Jesuit missionary on a journey to France--a journey that ended with Hu's confinement in a lunatic asylum. At once a triumph of historical detective work and a gripping narrative, <i>The Question of Hu </i>deftly probes the collision of tw ocultures, with their different definitions of faith, madness, and moral obligation.</p><p>Jonathan Spence's eleven books on Chinese history include&nbsp;<i>The Gate of Heavenly Peace</i>,&nbsp;<i>Treason by the Book</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Death of Woman Wang</i>. His awards include a Guggenheim and a MacArthur Fellowship. He teaches at Yale University.To French Jesuit Jean-Francois Foucquet, John Hua Chinese widower from Canton and a convert to Catholicismseemed like the perfect choice to serve as the missionary's translator and assistant. So Foucquet took Hu back to Paris with him in 1722, but Hu acted bizarrely on the overseas crossing and was confined for two years in the lunatic asylum of Charenton. In this slim travelogue, historian Spence ( The Gate of Heavenly Peace ) narrates their tragic tale in the form of an imaginary log, reconstructed from French, British and Vatican archives. Hu's behavior was clearly irrational: he wielded a knife, made strange proclamations, slept outdoors. But was he insane, and if so, did his journey to the West somehow trigger the reaction? Father Doucquet acted badly (he ditched Hu, who became an embarrassment to him), but to what extent was the Jesuit responsible for Hu's fate? The available evidence can't answer these questions, and we are left with a fragmentary puzzle.

Isn't wanting sinful and selfish? Aren't we supposed to find and follow God's will rather than insisting upon our own? The story of each person is a story of want&#x2015;desires unmet, hopes dashed, passions pursued and ambitions fulfilled. Our wants cannot be ignored. But when desire is informed by Scripture and re-formed by our spiritual practices, it can root us more deeply in the fundamental belief that God is good and generous and can invite us into active kingdom participation. Jen Pollock Michel guides us on a journey of understanding who we are when we want, and reintroduces us to a God who gives us the desires of our hearts. That same good God calls us into a new reality in which we seek first his kingdom and righteousness, and we discover our disordered desires burned away while our truest longings are happily fulfilled and purified. The disciples asked Jesus to "Teach us to pray." This book asks, "Teach us to want."</p><p>Jen Pollock Michel is a writer, speaker and mother of five. She writes regularly for Her.meneutics.com and <em>Today in the Word.</em>"Most of us have wanted something at some point in life. Some of us live with a deep void in our souls that never seems to be filled. How do we live with such desires? How do we respond to the emotions brought on by longing and wanting? With raw honesty and a scriptural foundation, Michel shows that our desires have a place in the journey of faith." (Courtney Reissig, Christianity Today's 2015 Book Awards (Book of the Year), January/February 2015)<br><br>"In <em>Teach Us to Want</em>, Toronto-based writer Jen Pollock Michel challenges conventional Christian notions about heeding desire. She helps us understand that what we want isn't our enemy, but can be one of God's most powerful tools for shaping and directing us. We might easily think of desire as all bad, but Michel argues that desire, rightly understood, should be followed." (Laura Turner, Christianity Today, July/August 2014)<br><br>"'Desire is primal: to be human is to want,' writes Jen Pollock Michel in the opening chapter of her praiseworthy new book <em>Teach Us to Want</em>. Certainly this is not new information, but in this compelling book that masterfully interweaves juicy personal narrative, scholarly research, and solid biblical exegesis, Michel builds a case for the importance of examining desire's many facets: 'Desire is the powerful subtext of our lives. It determines decisions. This is why we need to pay attention to it.' "With grace and humor, she bravely bares her own stories of struggle with wanting and loss, hope and doubt. Her vulnerability elicits the reader's trust. Here is a worthy and compassionate guide to join on this important journey; Michel helps us distinguish between <em>What do I want?</em> and <em>What does God want for me?</em> "Using the Lord's Prayer as a rubric to frame our naked wanting, the reader is invited to consider Jesus' language of prayer as a way of realigning our hearts with God's purposes and priorities. These 'are words we pray, not always because we believe them but because we want to believe them.' Our desires, though warped by our sin, have been placed in us by God, and it is <em>his</em> desire to recalibrate our hearts for the glory of his kingdom. Though it would be easy to float off in many divergent theoretical theological directions, the book stays grounded through relatable stories and practical application. . . . "This is the kind of book you set down not because it has lost your interest, but because you need time to soak in its profound intricacy." (Aleah Marsden, Books Culture, August 2014)<br><br>"Seriously, one of the most beautiful nonfiction books I have ever read." (Bethany Jenkins, founder, The Park Forum)<br><br>"Jen Pollock Michel's <em>Teach Us to Want</em> is a beautiful spiritual memoir that weaves the author's story with passages from Scripture that address&#x2015;and even gracefully redress&#x2015;her restless fears and questions. Intelligent, honest and inspiring, the book invites readers to understand their own stories of loss and "loving wrongly" in the light of that which is truly the antidote to our fears and dissatisfaction, the good news." (Jennifer Grant, author of Love You More, MOMumental, Wholehearted Living and Disquiet Time)<br><br>"In her debut book, Jen Pollock Michel offers a meditation on what it means to walk the line between dismissing our desires as evil and abandoning ourselves to them. The book's mix of narrative and biblical reflection nudges us into deeper contemplation of our desires, God and the ends toward which our desires are driving us." (Relevant Magazine, September-October 2014)<br><br>"'Lead me not into ambition,' I have prayed, sideways, with the weight of ambition on my shoulders. Who has not wrestled with the tensions between what we desire and what (we think) God desires? Michel has brilliantly lit a way through our own dark, tangled brambles. I've been waiting for this book for a long time." (Leslie Leyland Fields, author of Forgiving Our Fathers and Mothers)<br><br>"Michel artfully weaves together Scripture and story to point us straight to the truth of God's love, grace and provision. This is not a Christian guide to success or a biblical condemnation of desire. This is a book that rightly resets our human desires into the context of God's good news." (Kathy Khang, coauthor of More Than Serving Tea)<br><br>"As women, we often feel the urge to hide our longings, especially in the church. Through her own story of fear, loss and God's goodness, Jen stirs us to recover and reshape these desires in light of the kingdom of God." (Rebekah Lyons, author of Freefall to Fly)<br><br>"Jen Pollock Michel fuses three things that make her book essential reading: deep insight, raw honesty and radiant prose. She's a terrific writer, an agile thinker and&#x2015;if that were not enough&#x2015;a fearless witness to her own heart's darkness and light. By inviting me deeply into the mess and beauty of her own story, she has given me courage to step into the mess and beauty of my own&#x2015;and, with her, to meet afresh the One who awakens, names, purifies and meets all the desires of my heart."

At a time when so many aspects of our lives are changing at a relentless speed on an unprecedented scale, design is increasingly seen as a way to help us benefit from the opportunities created by those changes (and to avoid their dangers).</p><p>Design is responding to an age of intense economic, political and ecological instability with resourcefulness and creativity. Public interest is soaring as a new generation of designers is using advanced technologies to pursue their political and environmental objectives in increasingly ambitious projects, as well as to reinvent the objects and spaces we use every day.</p><p>Written by one of the world&#x2019;s leading design and culture commentators, London-based critic and journalist Alice Rawsthorn, <i>Design as an Attitude</i> is conceived as a subjective field guide to design.

Foster care agencies team up with companies to take disability and survivor benefits from abused and neglected children. States and their revenue consultants use illusory schemes to siphon Medicaid funds intended for children and the poor into general state coffers. Child support payments for foster children and families on public assistance are converted into government revenue. And the poverty industry keeps expanding, leaving us with nursing homes and juvenile detention centers that sedate residents to reduce costs and maximize profit, local governments buying nursing homes to take the facilities&#x2019; federal aid while the elderly languish with poor care, and counties hiring companies to mine the poor for additional funds in modern day debtor&#x2019;s prisons.</p><p>In The Poverty Industry, Daniel L. Hatcher shows us how state governments and their private industry partners are profiting from the social safety net, turning America&#x2019;s most vulnerable populations into sources of revenue. The poverty industry is stealing billions in federal aid and other funds from impoverished families, abused and neglected children, and the disabled and elderly poor. As policy experts across the political spectrum debate how to best structure government assistance programs, a massive siphoning of the safety net is occurring behind the scenes.In the face of these abuses of power, Hatcher offers a road map for reforms to realign the practices of human service agencies with their intended purpose, to prevent the misuse of public taxpayer dollars, and to ensure that government aid truly gets to those in need.</p></p><p><b>Daniel L. Hatcher</b> is Professor of Law at the University of Baltimore."A law professor at the University of Baltimore who has represented Maryland victims of such schemes, Hatcher presents a distressing picture of how states routinely defraud taxpayers of millions of federal dollars." (<i>Boston Review</i>)<br><br>"In the tradition of great muckraking, Hatcher has exposed how states and localities have misdirected and misused public funds envisioned to benefit the most vulnerable among us. . . . Should be required reading for lawmakers and public officials, to remind them of their legal and moral responsibilities and to inspire them to stop these disturbing practices and direct these crucial resources to their rightful recipients." (Jane M. Spinak,Edward Ross Aranow Clinical Professor of Law, Columbia University)<br><br>""Poverty is here painted as an industry that, like the defense industry, has an iron triangle. As explored by Hatcher, it depicts revenue maximization services and contingency fees that decrease the funds from the federal government that go to helping children and the poor." (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"Daniel Hatcher meticulously explains the impact of deregulated privatisation on America's already residual care services." (<i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>"In this meticulously researched book Hatcher, who has represented vulnerable people in court for years, including children in foster care, lifts the lid on a system that rather than helping the needy, systematically turns them into 'a source of revenue'." (<i>The Guardian,Mary O'Hara</i>)<br><br>"[An] important book...Hatcher has done a great public service by shining a light on these massive distortions." (<i>Stanford Social Innovation Review</i>)<br><br>"Hatcher provides beautiful examples of unintended consequences of government policies: states rip off the federal government because the federal government has unwittingly incentivized the states to do exactly that." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"Hatcher exposes an urgent paradox at the heart of American governance: why, and how, are states and localities teaming up with corporations to squeeze profits from societys poorest? The Poverty Industry breaks fresh ground. Every American who cares about the intersection of private profits and public justice should read this book, and wrestle with its arguments. Hatcher marshals years of legal experience and research towards fulfilling the muckrakers calling: 'to comfort the afflicted, and afflict the comfortable.' But he also goes a step further. In The Poverty Industry, he combines a practitioners depth with a journalists flair for storytelling, to generate the first complete account of a little-known phenomenon that should be of interest to every reader with a conscience." (Sarah Stillman,staff writer for the New Yorker)<br><br>"Everyone today is skeptical of charitable organizations that spend too little of their money on charity. After reading this book, Americans are sure to become just as skeptical when state and local governments spend federal tax dollars. Hatchers tour-de-force spells out how federal government spending on services for the poor are being wasted. . . . No one who reads this book will ever feel the same about fiscal federalism. . . . Hatcher shows that a shocking amount of money is going to profit private businesses. Even worse, these businesses are teaching state and local governments how to scam the feds by taking money for one purpose and misusing it to help fill a hole in the state budget outside of the purposes for which the money is being given. An extremely important book." (Martin Guggenheim,Fiorello LaGuardia Professor of Clinical Law, New York University)<br><br>"Hatcher throws light on what can be hidden processes in human services budgeting, contracting, and implementation.The Poverty Industrywalks through the evolution of legal doctrine regarding rights of vulnerable persons...The narrative provides compelling evidence that scholars, policymakers, and advocates should take a closer look at the political and business relationships shaping contracting decisions involving for-profit firms."

Not for me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-From the correspondence of</p><p>James Graham and Camilla Easton, 1971</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Graham House was a respite from the late-June heat, especially in the air-conditioned office of my collaborator and hero, Camilla Graham. I was there now, sitting on the floor and telling an amused Camilla the story of my first date, which had involved much awkward conversation and an even more awkward attempt at a kiss, and I had reduced Camilla to a giggling fit more than once as the story progressed. It was amusing to both of us to contemplate my fifteen-year-old self, pretending to be a sophisticated woman while being scared to death. Camilla's German shepherds, pleased to see me at floor level, had immediately demanded petting, and Heathcliff was starting to lean on me as he relaxed into my massage. "Heathcliff, get off! You giant rug. You're making me hot. You, too, Rochester." They smiled at me with open, panting mouths, remaining exactly where they were.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Camilla laughed. "You've spoiled them, Lena. They get much more attention now that there are two of us in the house-double the walks and the petting. And now that I hired this little local girl to take them out sometimes, they have three devoted mistresses. Clearly they are smug about it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I sniffed and looked into the brown eyes of each dog. "What's in it for me, you guys?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They had no suggestions. A crash sounded from above us, followed by some loud swearing. "Oh no," I said. "That doesn't sound good."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Camilla stared up at the ceiling, as if trying to see through it. "I hope no one is hurt."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I hope the air conditioners are still intact," I said, perhaps selfishly. Camilla had central air, but somehow it only cooled the ground floor of her big old house. When the heat wave began, Adam Rayburn, Camilla's steady boyfriend, enlisted the help of a group he called the "Three Amigos," namely Doug Heller, Sam West, and Cliff Blake, to install window units in the bedrooms upstairs. The younger men had spent a great deal of time together in the last month, and they did in fact seem to function well as a group of three-at least when they were doing "guy" things. At other times they invited me to join them, along with Doug's girlfriend, Belinda.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It will be nice to have those window units," Camilla said. "They should make for better sleeping. Adam assured me that the machines are not loud."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It will be wonderful. Up until this last week I never had a problem with the temperature. I slept with the window open and enjoyed the nice breeze. But now the air is just-stagnant. I thought it was always cooler by the lake."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Camilla nodded. "We mostly have mild summers, but we've been prone to heat waves in early July, which begins in just a few days, can you believe it?" She shook her head, apparently marveling at the rapid passage of time. "You're more of a fall person, aren't you? You do look a bit like a wilted flower there on the floor."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'll perk up now that I'm in here. But walking to town this morning wasn't a good idea. It's incredibly humid out there."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We heard loud footsteps descending the stairs, and Doug Heller's blond head poked into the room. "Camilla, where might I find a toolbox?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Camilla pointed. "The closet in the kitchen hallway. Bottom shelf."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Great, thanks!" he said, darting into the next room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Everything okay up there?" Camilla asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Fine," Doug said. "A minor emergency, but we handled it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You taught me some new swear words," I called to him, winking at Camilla.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Doug appeared in the doorway, looking slightly guilty. "You heard that? It wasn't me, anyway, it was Cliff. Something fell on his toe."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh my gosh! Is he okay?" I asked. The dogs became alert at my tone; their ears stood at attention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"He's fine. He's looking forward to the cold beer Camilla promised."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm chilling the glasses as we speak," Camilla said. She stood up behind her desk and moved toward the kitchen. She wore a light summer dress of pale pink and a pair of white sandals. "I'll go check on them."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Doug went in with her, and I was left alone with the dogs. "I mean it, you guys, that's enough petting. I'm too hot to be surrounded by fur." I gave them each a last pat and then pushed slightly on their flanks. They got the message and ambled over to Camilla's desk, under which they liked to sleep during the day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The doorbell rang. I managed to pull myself upright, feeling languid still, and to walk to the entrance hall. I peered through the window to see an elderly woman on the steps, looking like a mirage in the hazy heat; I did not recognize her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I opened the door. "Hello," I said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She studied me for a moment. She was tall and thin, with a halo of white hair. She wore a black cotton dress that draped down to her ankles; it looked severe, almost punishing, considering the temperature. Her hazel eyes were narrowed with a quizzical expression. "I'm here to see Camilla," she said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"May I ask your name?" I said. I had no idea if this woman were a friend or a determined fan-Camilla did get unwelcome visitors now and again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She jutted out her chin. "Tell her it's Jane Wyland. She knows who I am. But it's been a long, long time." She didn't smile when she said this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I knew it would be polite to invite her in, but I didn't want to admit anyone to Camilla's house unless I knew Camilla wanted them there. "Excuse me for just a moment," I said. I left the door slightly ajar, so it didn't seem as if I were closing it in her face, and then I jogged to the kitchen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Camilla was peering into the freezer, where the glasses were nicely chilled and waiting to be filled with beer. Doug had apparently gone back upstairs. "Lena, can you call up to the boys and ask when they think they'll be down?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The boys. This made me smile, but something about the woman at the door distracted me from my amusement. "Yes, I'll do that. I don't know if you heard the doorbell, but there's a woman here to see you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She closed the freezer and turned, brows raised. "Oh? Who is it?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't know her. She said her name is Jane Wyland."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Camilla blinked at me. "Jane Wyland? I-my goodness. I haven't seen that woman in more than forty years."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Should I-?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'll talk to her. Thank you, Lena."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I lingered near the doorway and heard Camilla greet the visitor in a rather stiff voice. The woman said something, and Camilla said, "Why don't you come in? We can talk in my study." And then, in response to a question, "That was Lena. She is my friend and writing collaborator. She lives here with me, actually."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They were closer now, and I heard the woman named Jane Wyland say, "You probably didn't think you'd ever hear from me again, did you, Camilla?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Camilla's voice was smooth, unruffled. "I confess I didn't imagine our paths would cross, but then again, life has a way of bringing us back to our origins."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They moved into Camilla's office, and Camilla closed the door.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A shadow moved on the wall, and I jumped when a pair of hands touched my shoulders. "Hey," said Sam West.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I turned and whispered, "Hey."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He leaned in to give me a warm kiss. "Hey," I said again, appreciatively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Why are you whispering?" he asked, smiling at me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I spoke a bit louder, though still quietly. "Camilla has some woman in there. She hasn't seen her in decades, and they went in the office and closed the door."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Do you think we should call the police?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I poked him in the chest. "Very funny. But I got a weird vibe. And it's not like ominous things haven't happened around here before."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's for sure." He looked around the kitchen. "I'm supposed to make sure that beer is in the offing."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, right. I'll help you pour." We retrieved the chilled glasses from the freezer and I pulled three bottles of Corona from the fridge. As we worked, I asked, "Everything okay up there?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was pouring carefully, trying to avoid too much foam. "Your chamber shall be cool and pleasant, my queen."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, thank goodness. I just cannot sleep when it's that hot."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He took a sip of his drink. "If you were awake, you should have walked down the hill to your boyfriend's house and told him of your insomnia. He has all sorts of ideas for night activities."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I laughed. "I spend plenty of nights at Sam House, so I know all about your night activities, and I approve. But when I'm working and staying here, I need the kind of cool you have over there in your gorgeous modern marvel of a house." Sam had jokingly started referring to his place, right down the bluff from Graham House, as "Sam House," and those two buildings had become my two residences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Doug and Cliff came in and practically dove on the refreshments. Sam said, "Do you guys have time to sit for a while?" They nodded, and our group of four moved to Camilla's sunroom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I flopped into a chair near the window. "Thank you so much to all of you. I am not a creature who thrives in the heat. Camilla said I looked like a wilted flower, and I felt like one this past week."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You need to go down and jump in the lake when it gets this hot," Doug said, shrugging. "Ned Purchase offered us full access to his private strip of beach-he's in New York until September. Belinda and I have been in the water constantly."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You just want to see her in a bathing suit," I joked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Doug grinned. "She has some great bathing suits, but we've also opted for the au naturel experience. She rocks that, too."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sam's eyes met mine. "We should swim more, Lena."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cliff sighed. "Have a heart. Some people at this table have no significant other."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I touched his arm. "Why is that? How does a handsome guy like you end up coming to Blue Lake all alone?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cliff took a swig of beer and sighed. "Sam has already heard this whole story. There was someone. Beth. We lived together for several years. It didn't work out, but we parted on good terms. I think she's married now." He looked out the window at the lake, which was still as glass on this windless day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Maybe she just wasn't the right one for you," I said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cliff shrugged. "I've always been a little too devoted to the job. And I was-kind of obsessing over Sam West in those years. Following up on every little thing I could learn about my little brother here. Beth told me to just contact him, but I was stubborn."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We thought about that for a while. Cliff had finally taken a job in Blue Lake just to be closer to Sam, who hadn't known he had a half brother.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Doug pointed at his fellow cop. "We've got to get this guy back into the dating pool. Lots of attractive women in this town."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I studied Cliff and had a sudden inspiration. "You know what, Cliff? I know someone I think you would really enjoy meeting. And I know she would like you. You meet several of her criteria for what makes a good man."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sam laughed. "And how do you know this woman's criteria?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"She went to high school with Allison and me. She graduated a couple years before we did; she pursued veterinary school, and she got a job at an animal hospital in Chicago, but they ended up reducing their staff. Allison's been trying to get her to Blue Lake-you know Allison. She wants all her friends to come here."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It worked with you," Doug said. We exchanged a smile; we both recalled the day that I came to town, lured by a phone call from Allison Branch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Allison's been sending her clippings of job openings at animal hospitals in this area. Allie is hilarious in her enthusiasm, as always. But Isabelle really is considering coming out for some interviews."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Isabelle," said Cliff appreciatively. "That's a pretty name."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes." I studied him. "Isabelle's the whole package: smart, pretty, fun. Like you, she was with someone, but he ended up revealing his true character, and Isabelle dumped him."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Good for her," Sam said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cliff shrugged. "Well, if she ever comes to town, I'd be happy to meet her. Meanwhile, I'm on duty in about an hour and I need to get home and put on the uniform."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Doug's face changed; he always looked serious when he thought about cop things. "I'm off today, and I have plans to take Belinda to Warrenville for a movie and dinner. But if you hear any more about our vandal, let me know."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Blue Lake has a vandal?" I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Doug and Cliff both took on that shuttered look that law enforcement people get when they can't share information. "Don't we always?" Doug said lightly. He stood up, and so did Cliff.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I turned to Sam. "I think your playmates are leaving."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sam stood and joined the other two as they walked to the kitchen door. The men exchanged some of those hearty man-hugs and thumped one another loudly on the back. I darted in and hugged them all, too. "I appreciate your help, and I always love your company. Come back soon, and we'll play a board game in Camilla's nice cool house."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Invite Isabelle, too," Cliff joked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Doug put a hand on my shoulder. "Belinda wants to have a little get-together at her place soon. She's thinking maybe a Fourth of July party. She'll be contacting you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Okay! Sounds fun," I said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I waved and watched from the kitchen doorway as Sam walked his friends to the front door and saw them out. He shut the door and turned to say something to me, but he was interrupted by a loud voice saying, "Of course you would protect him! You were in love with him!" Camilla's study door flew open and the woman named Jane Wyland came stalking out, her fists clenched at her sides. Camilla emerged as well, her face paler than I had ever seen it, her eyes desolate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Wyland woman moved to the front door without saying a word, but when she reached the place where Sam stood, she pointed at him and said, "The notorious Sam West. It figures he would be your friend. That says a lot about your family, doesn't it? The whole Graham family. I'll be back tomorrow, Camilla. So make your decision."</p></p><h2>Adam and Eve After the Pill: Paradoxes of the Sexual Revolution</h2><p>Secular and religious thinkers agree: the sexual revolution is one of the most important milestones in human history. Perhaps nothing has changed life for so many, so fast, as the severing of sex and procreation. But what has been the result? This ground-breaking book by noted essayist and author Mary Eberstadt contends that sexual freedom has paradoxically produced widespread discontent. Drawing on sociologists Pitirim Sorokin, Carle Zimmerman, and others; philosopher G.E.M. Anscombe and novelist Tom Wolfe; and a host of feminists, food writers, musicians, and other voices from across today&#39;s popular culture, Eberstadt makes her contrarian case with an impressive array of evidence. Her chapters range across academic disciplines and include supporting evidence from contemporary literature and music, women&#39;s studies, college memoirs, dietary guides, advertisements, television shows, and films. Adam and Eve after the Pill examines as no book has before the seismic social changes caused by the sexual revolution. In examining human behavior in the post-liberation world, Eberstadt provocatively asks: Is food the new sex? Is pornography the new tobacco? Adam and Eve after the Pill will change the way readers view the paradoxical impact of the sexual revolution on ideas, morals, and humanity itself.</p><p>Editor Mary Eberstadt is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, Contributing Editor to &#34;Policy Review, &#34; and author of &#34;Home-Alone America: The Hidden Toll of Day Care, Behavioral Drugs, and Other Parent Substitutes.&#34; She is former managing editor of the &#34;Public Interest&#34; and former executive editor of the &#34;National Interest.&#34;"Mary Eberstadt is our premier analyst of American cultural foibles and follies, with a keen eye for oddities that illuminate just how strange the country's moral culture has become." --<b>-George Weigel</b>, Ethics and Public Policy Center<br><br>"If you want to learn what the Pill and the ensuing sexual revolution really accomplished, you must read <i>Adam and Eve After the Pill</i>. Of course, neo-Malthusians talk up the Pill's benefits: the freedom from having children made it possible for women to pursue serious careers and in the process offered men a new kind of freedom, too. But as Eberstadt writes, how about the increasing unhappiness of women despite their liberation from the chores of raising children? Or husbands' loss of interest in their wives and the corresponding increase in male pornography addiction? Not to be ignored, either, is the effect of the sexual revolution on college campuses by date rapes, hookups, and binge drinking, all of which directly flow from the sexual revolution mandate that women must be sexually available." --<b>-Dr. Raymond Dennehy</b>, University of San Francisco<br><br>"The federal government - <i>our</i> United States federal government - is currently pushing the views expressed in this book to the sidelines. <i>Adam and Eve after the Pill</i> is a protest vote - a first among many. The Catholic bishops didn't just dream up a fight over contraception; it was forced on them, as Catholics' conscience rights have been directly trampled on. It's a moment for a badly needed education and reflection on the immiseration of the last few decades - one that has pitted Adam and Eve against one another in a most unnatural way. Mary Eberstadt's book is a treasure and a resource and a cultural catechesis. Please read it. And then share it." --<b>- Kathryn Jean Lopez</b>, editor-at-large, <i><b>National Review Online</b></i></p><h2>Lost City: The Discovery of Machu Picchu</h2><p>Caldecott Honor-winner Ted Lewin takes readers on a thrilling journey to the wilds of Peru in this story of Hiram Bingham, who, in 1911, carved a treacherous path through snake-filled jungles and across perilous mountains in search of Vilcapampa, the lost city of the Incas. Guided the last steps by a young Quechua boy, however, he discovered not the rumored lost city, but the ruins of Machu Picchu, a city totally unknown to the outside world, and one of the wonders of the world.</p><p>Ted Lewin grew up in an old frame house in Buffalo, New York, with two brothers, one sister, two parents, a lion, an iguana, a chimpanzee, and an assortment of more conventional pets.

In 1911, a Yale professor in search of a lost Inca city was led to the site of Machu Picchu by local Indians. In this lavishly illustrated picture book, Lewin traces Professor Bingham's steps through the tangled mountain jungle to his exciting discovery. The language is graceful and uncomplicated, weaving in bits of background history along the way, and Lewin builds suspense at just the right pace: "They came to a grand stone staircase. Where could this lead? What else was here?" But it's the artwork that will really attract attention. Full-page watercolor spreads of the stunning vistas and thick forests contrast with dark, intimate views of Bingham inside homes and walking along walled city streets, searching for leads. A map of Peru and suggested further reading lists would have been welcome additions, but Lewin includes comprehensive notes that explain the excavation of Machu Picchu, as well as the primary sources he consulted. An exciting, eye-catching story for early elementary social studies units. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He has won the Hugo, Nebula, Mythopoeic, and Grand Prix de l&#x2019;Imaginaire awards as well as the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement.*Starred Review* When Beagle's <i>A Fine and Private Place </i>(1960), a story of two ghosts in love, emerged virtually simultaneously with other brilliant debuts by Philip Roth, Reynolds Price, and Wendell Berry, he was hailed as one of their cohort of promising American novelists. <i>The Last Unicorn</i> (1968), however, disclosed him delving more deeply into fantasy (the unicorn is the protagonist, not a metaphor), and he was critically drummed out of the troop. He hardly lost his talent, though, and ever since <i>Last Unicorn</i>, one of the most beloved fantasies ever written, fantasy critics and readers have treasured his work, all the more so because he isn't prolific. For all their variety--four fables, a children's story for all ages, a Sherlock Holmes pastiche, an old tar's tall tale, a sequel to one novel (<i>Last Unicorn</i>) and a prequel to another (<i>The Innkeeper's Song</i>, 1993), and the germ of a prospective witch novel--all 10 stories in this book are lucid and refreshing as spring water, full of amusement, humanity, and wisdom. Perhaps Beagle is incapable of writing genuinely dark fantasy, but his tall tale "Salt Wine" touches the tonalities of R. L. Stevenson in "The Bottle Imp" and W. W. Jacobs in "The Monkey's Paw," while on the other end of the spectrum, the <i>Last Unicorn</i> follow-up "Two Hearts" is like Kenneth Grahame's "Reluctant Dragon" with greater gravitas. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

And once the War of 1812 starts, that&#39;s not necessarily a good thing. For the British have targeted the town as part of their campaign to defeat America in its fight to maintain its independence. And now, in August of 1813 the British fleet is sailing up the Chesapeake River to St. Michaels. The town&#39;s militia is assembled but no one expects they can win the fight against the powerful British cannons. Citizens are being evacuated and the town is in turmoil. All young Henry Middle wants to do is find his father amid the chaos of the coming attack. The lanterns he carries will be of use to the militia. As Henry works to conquer his rising fear, he realizes he may hold the answer to outsmarting the British in his very hands. Lisa Papp studied at Iowa State University College of Design and at Du Cret School for the Arts. The Town that Fooled the British marks her authorial debut.

Alvarez set for himself...He has succeeded." &#x2015;<em>New York Times</em></strong></p><p>"Suicide," writes the notes English poet and critic A. Alvarez, "has permeated Western culture like a dye that cannot be washed out." Although the aims of this compelling, compassionate work are broadly cultural and literary, the narrative is rooted in personal experience: it begins with a long memoir of Sylvia Plath, and ends with an account of the author's own suicide attempt. Within this dramatic framework, Alvarez launches his enquiry into the final taboo of human behavior, and traces changing attitudes towards suicide from the perspective of literature. He follows the black thread leading from Dante through Donne and the romantic agony, to the Savage God at the heart of modern literature.</p></p><p>A.

Now what? How do you turn this raw material into finished stories, essays, poems, novels, memoirs? <br><br>Drawing on her own experience as a writer and a student of Zen, Natalie shows you how to create a field big enough to allow your &#x201c;wild mind&#x201d; to wander &#x2014; and then gently direct its tremendous energy into whatever you want to write.<br><br>Here, too, is invaluable advice on how to overcome writer&#x2019;s block, how to deal with the fear of criticism and rejection, how to get the most from working with an editor, and how to learn from reading accomplished authors. <br><br>With humor and compassion, Goldberg recounts her own mistakes on the way to publication &#x2014; and how you can avoid the most common pitfalls of the beginning writer. Through it all there is a deep celebration of writing itself &#x2014; not just as the means to an end, but as a path to living a deeper, more fully alive life.</p><p>More musings from Natalie Goldberg on writing as a spiritual path, as "an authentic Zen way." Goldberg has some nice things to say about the importance of the process of writing. She recommends her students spend two years at writing "practice" before undertaking a specific project, so that they can "get in touch with their wild minds." The most inspired writing, she says, comes when one's conscious mind gets out of the way. Still, we are puzzled by <i>Thunder and Lightning</i>: is it really meant to show us how to turn "our flashes of inspiration ... into a polished piece of work," as the book jacket touts? It comes off more as a collection of Goldberg's ruminations on writing and reading. Goldberg tells us about her friend Julie's writing process. Another pal, Kate, talks about plot. We study Styron with Goldberg's workshop students and take a road trip through the South to try to figure out just how some of the poorest states in the union managed to produce so many great writers. There are some good stories here, and it's vaguely interesting to know what Nat likes to order when she does her caf� writing or lunches with her editors, but we end up desiring a little less wandering and a little more focus. <i>--Jane Steinberg</i>In the long-awaited sequel to her bestselling &#34;Writing Down the Bones&#34;, Goldberg takes listeners to the next step of the writing process: turning our flashes of inspiration--the thunder and lightning--into a polished piece of work.

Kit Carson (1809&#x2013;68) wanted to be a mountain man, and he spent his next sixteen years learning the paths of the West, the ways of its Native inhabitants, and the habits of the beaver, becoming the most successful and respected fur trapper of his time.&nbsp;From 1842 to 1848 he guided John C. Fr�mont&#x2019;s mapping expeditions through the Rockies and was instrumental in the U.S. military conquest of California during the Mexican War. In 1853 he was appointed Indian agent at Taos, and later he helped negotiate treaties with the Apaches, Kiowas, Comanches, Arapahos, Cheyennes, and Utes that finally brought peace to the southwestern frontier.&nbsp;Ralph Moody&#x2019;s biography of Kit Carson, appropriate for readers young and old, is a testament to the judgment and loyalty of the man who had perhaps more influence than any other on the history and development of the American West.</p><p>Western writer Ralph Moody (1898&#x2013;1982) grew up in Carson territory in southeastern Colorado.

In 2014, this tiny square of faded red paper sold at Sotheby&#x2019;s for nearly $9.5 million, the largest amount ever paid for a postage stamp at auction. Through the stories of the eccentric characters who have bought, owned, and sold the one-cent magenta in the years in between, James Barron delivers a fascinating tale of global history and immense wealth, and of the human desire to collect.<br> &nbsp;<br> One-cent magentas were provisional stamps, printed quickly in what was then British Guiana when a shipment of official stamps from London did not arrive. They were intended for periodicals, and most were thrown out with the newspapers. But one stamp survived. The singular one-cent magenta has had only nine owners since a twelve-year-old boy discovered it in 1873 as he sorted through papers in his uncle&#x2019;s house. He soon sold it for what would be $17 today. (That&#x2019;s been called the worst stamp deal in history.) Among later owners was a fabulously wealthy Frenchman who hid the stamp from almost everyone (even King George V of England couldn&#x2019;t get a peek); a businessman who traveled with the stamp in a briefcase he handcuffed to his wrist; and John E. du Pont, an heir to the chemical fortune, who died while serving a thirty-year sentence for the murder of Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz.<br> &nbsp;<br> Recommended for fans of Nicholas A. Basbanes, Susan Orlean, and Simon Winchester, <i>The One-Cent Magenta</i> explores the intersection of obsessive pursuits and great affluence and asks why we want most what is most rare.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>James Barron is a reporter for the <i>New York Times</i>, where his writing has appeared in virtually every section of the paper.

A former teacher herself, she grew up in Wales and now lives in Canada.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br>Claudia Martin had already had a hard day at school.<br><br>First Mademoiselle Pierre, one of the nonresident teachers, had sent a messenger just before breakfast with the news that she was indisposed with a migraine headache and would be unable to come to school, and Claudia, as both owner and headmistress, had been obliged to conduct most of the French and music classes in addition to her own subjects. French was no great problem; music was more of a challenge. Worse, the account books, which she had intended to bring up to date during her spare classes today, remained undone, with days fast running out in which to get accomplished all the myriad tasks that needed doing.<br><br>Then just before the noonday meal, when classes were over for the morning and discipline was at its slackest, Paula Hern had decided that she objected to the way Molly Wiggins looked at her and voiced her displeasure publicly and eloquently. And since Paula's father was a successful businessman and as rich as Croesus and she put on airs accordingly while Molly was the youngest&#x2014;and most timid&#x2014;of the charity girls and did not even know who her father was, then of course Agnes Ryde had felt obliged to jump into the fray in vigorous defense of the downtrodden, her Cockney accent returning with ear-jarring clarity. Claudia had been forced to deal with the matter and extract more-or-less sincere apologies from all sides and mete out suitable punishments to all except the more-or-less innocent Molly.<br><br>Then, an hour later, just when Miss Walton had been about to step outdoors with the junior class en route to Bath Abbey, where she had intended to give an informal lesson in art and architecture, the heavens had opened in a downpour to end downpours and there had been all the fuss of finding the girls somewhere else to go within the school and something else to do. Not that that had been Claudia's problem, but she had been made annoyingly aware of the girls' loud disappointment beyond her classroom door as she struggled to teach French irregular verbs. She had finally gone out there to inform them that if they had any complaint about the untimely arrival of the rain, then they must take it up privately with God during their evening prayers, but in the meantime they would be silent until Miss Walton had closed a classroom door behind them.<br><br>Then, just after classes were finished for the afternoon and the girls had gone upstairs to comb their hair and wash their hands ready for tea, something had gone wrong with the doorknob on one of the dormitories and eight of the girls, trapped inside until Mr. Keeble, the elderly school porter, had creaked his way up there to release them before mending the knob, had screeched and giggled and rattled the door. Miss Thompson had dealt with the crisis by reading them a lecture on patience and decorum, though circumstances had forced her to speak in a voice that could be heard from within&#x2014;and therefore through much of the rest of the school too, including Claudia's office.<br><br>It had not been the best of days, as Claudia had just been remarking&#x2014;without contradiction&#x2014;to Eleanor Thompson and Lila Walton over tea in her private sitting room a short while after the prisoners had been freed. She could do with far fewer such days.<br><br>And yet now!<br><br>Now, to cap everything off and make an already trying day more so, there was a marquess awaiting her pleasure in the visitors' parlor downstairs.<br><br>A marquess, for the love of all that was wonderful!<br><br>That was what the silver-edged visiting card she held between two fingers said&#x2014;the Marquess of Attingsborough. The porter had just delivered it into her hands, looking sour and disapproving as he did so&#x2014;a not unusual expression for him, especially when any male who was not a teacher invaded his domain.<br><br>"A marquess," she said, looking up from the card to frown at her fellow teachers. "Whatever can he want? Did he say, Mr. Keeble?"<br><br>"He did not say and I did not ask, miss," the porter replied. "But if you was to ask me, he is up to no good. He smiled at me."<br><br>"Ha! A cardinal sin indeed," Claudia said dryly while Eleanor laughed.<br><br>"Perhaps," Lila suggested, "he has a daughter he wishes to place at the school."<br><br>"A marquess?" Claudia raised her eyebrows and Lila looked suitably quelled.<br><br>"Perhaps, Claudia," Eleanor said, a twinkle in her eye, "he has two daughters."<br><br>Claudia snorted and then sighed, took one more sip of her tea, and got reluctantly to her feet.<br><br>"I suppose I had better go and see what he wants," she said. "It will be more productive than sitting here guessing. But of all things to happen today of all days. A marquess."<br><br>Eleanor laughed again. "Poor man," she said. "I pity him."<br><br>Claudia had never had much use for the aristocracy&#x2014;idle, arrogant, cold-hearted, nasty lot&#x2014;though the marriage of two of her teachers and closest friends to titled gentlemen had forced her to admit during the past few years that perhaps some of them might be agreeable and even worthy individuals. But it did not amuse her to have one of their number, a stranger, intrude into her own world without a by-your-leave, especially at the end of a difficult day.<br><br>She did not believe for a single moment that this marquess wished to place any daughter of his at her school.<br><br>She preceded Mr. Keeble down the stairs since she did not wish to move at his slow pace. She ought, she supposed, to have gone into her bedchamber first to see that she was looking respectable, which she was quite possibly not doing after a hard day at school. She usually made sure that she presented a neat appearance to visitors. But she scorned to make such an effort for a marquess and risk appearing obsequious in her own eyes.<br><br>By the time she opened the door into the visitors' parlor, she was bristling with a quite unjustified indignation. How dared he come here to disturb her on her own property, whatever his business might be.<br><br>She looked down at the visiting card still in her hand.<br><br>"The Marquess of Attingsborough?" she said in a voice not unlike the one she had used on Paula Hern earlier in the day&#x2014;the one that said she was not going to be at all impressed by any pretension of grandeur.<br><br>"At your service, ma'am. Miss Martin, I presume?" He was standing across the room, close to the window. He bowed elegantly.<br><br>Claudia's indignation soared. One steady glance at him was not sufficient upon which to make any informed judgment of his character, of course, but really, if the man had any imperfection of form or feature or taste in apparel, it was by no means apparent. He was tall and broad of shoulder and chest and slim of waist and hips. His legs were long and well shaped. His hair was dark and thick and shining, his face handsome, his eyes and mouth good-humored. He was dressed with impeccable elegance but without a trace of ostentation. His Hessian boots alone were probably worth a fortune, and Claudia guessed that if she were to stand directly over them and look down, she would see her own face reflected in them&#x2014;and probably her flat, untidy hair and limp dress collar as well.<br><br>She clasped her hands at her waist lest she test her theory by touching the collar points. She held his card pinched between one thumb and forefinger.<br><br>"What may I do for you, sir?" she asked, deliberately avoiding calling him my lord&#x2014;a ridiculous affectation, in her opinion.<br><br>He smiled at her, and if perfection could be improved upon, it had just happened&#x2014;he had good teeth. Claudia steeled herself to resist the charm she was sure he possessed in aces.<br><br>"I come as a messenger, ma'am," he said, "from Lady Whitleaf."<br><br>He reached into an inner pocket of his coat and withdrew a sealed paper.<br><br>"From Susanna?" Claudia took one step farther into the room.<br><br>Susanna Osbourne had been a teacher at the school until her marriage last year to Viscount Whitleaf. Claudia had always rejoiced at Susanna's good fortune in making both an eligible marriage and a love match and yet she still mourned her own loss of a dear friend and colleague and a good teacher. She had lost three such friends&#x2014;all in the same cause&#x2014;over the course of four years. Sometimes it was hard not to be selfishly depressed by it all.<br><br>"When she knew I was coming to Bath to spend a few days with my mother and my father, who is taking the waters," the marquess said, "she asked me to call here and pay my respects to you. And she gave me this letter, perhaps to convince you that I am no impostor."<br><br>His eyes smiled again as he came across the room and placed the letter in her hand. And as if at least his eyes could not have been mud-colored or something equally nondescript, she could see that they were a clear blue, almost like a summer sky.<br><br>Susanna had asked him to come and pay his respects? Why?<br><br>"Whitleaf is the cousin of a cousin of mine," the marquess explained. "Or an almost cousin of mine, anyway. It is complicated, as family relationships often are. Lauren Butler, Viscountess Ravensberg, is a cousin by virtue of the fact that her mother married my aunt's brother-in-law. We have been close since childhood. And Whitleaf is Lauren's first cousin. And so in a sense both he and his lady have a strong familial claim on me."<br><br>If he was a marquess, Claudia thought with sudden suspicion, and his father was still alive, what did that make his father? But he was here at Susanna's behest and it behooved her to be a little better than just icily polite.<br><br>"Thank you," she said, "for coming in person to deliver the letter. I am much obliged to you, sir. May I offer you a cup of tea?" She willed him to say no.<br><br>"I will not put you to that trouble, ma'am," he said, smiling again. "I understand you are to leave for London in two days' time?"<br><br>Ah. Susanna must have told him that. Mr. Hatchard, her man of business in London, had found employment for two of her senior girls, both charity pupils, but he had been unusually evasive about the identity of the prospective employers, even when she had asked quite specifically in her last letter to him. The paying girls at the school had families to look after their interests, of course. Claudia had appointed herself family to the rest and never released any girl who had no employment to which to go or any about whose expected employment she felt any strong misgiving.<br><br>At Eleanor's suggestion, Claudia was going to go to London with Flora Bains and Edna Wood so that she could find out exactly where they were to be placed as governesses and to withdraw her consent if she was not satisfied. There were still a few weeks of the school year left, but Eleanor had assured her that she was perfectly willing and able to take charge of affairs during Claudia's absence, which would surely be no longer than a week or ten days. Claudia had agreed to go, partly because there was another matter too upon which she wished to speak with Mr. Hatchard in person.<br><br>"I am," she told the marquess.<br><br>"Whitleaf intended to send a carriage for your convenience," the marquess told her, "but I was able to inform him that it would be quite unnecessary to put himself to the trouble."<br><br>"Of course it would," Claudia agreed. "I have already hired a carriage."<br><br>"I will see about unhiring it for you, if I may be permitted, ma'am," he said. "I plan to return to town on the same day and will be pleased to offer you the comfort of my own carriage and my protection for the journey."<br><br>Oh, goodness, heaven forbid!<br><br>"That will be quite unnecessary, sir," she said firmly. "I have already made the arrangements."<br><br>"Hired carriages are notorious for their lack of springs and all other comforts," he said. "I beg you will reconsider."<br><br>"Perhaps you do not fully understand, sir," she said. "I am to be accompanied by two schoolgirls on the journey."<br><br>"Yes," he said, "so Lady Whitleaf informed me. Do they prattle? Or, worse, do they giggle? Very young ladies have an atrocious tendency to do both."<br><br>"My girls are taught how to behave appropriately in company, Lord Attingsborough," she said stiffly. Too late she saw the twinkle in his eyes and understood that he had been joking.<br><br>"I do not doubt it, ma'am," he said, "and feel quite confident in trusting your word. Allow me, if you will, to escort all three of you ladies to Lady Whitleaf's door. She will be vastly impressed with my gallantry and will be bound to spread the word among my family and friends."<br><br>Now he was talking utter nonsense. But how could she decently refuse? She desperately searched around in her head for some irrefutable argument that would dissuade him. Nothing came to mind, however, that did not seem ungracious, even downright rude. But she would rather travel a thousand miles in a springless carriage than to London in his company.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Was she overawed by his title and magnificence? She bristled at the very idea.<br><br>At his . . . maleness, then? She was uncomfortably aware that he possessed that in abundance.<br>But how ridiculous that would be. He was simply a gentleman offering a courtesy to an aging spinster, who happened to be a friend of his almost-cousin's cousin's wife&#x2014;goodness, it was a tenuous connection. But she held a letter from Susanna in her hand. Susanna obviously trusted him.<br>An aging spinster? When it came to any consideration of age, she thought, there was probably not much difference between the two of them. Now there was a thought. Here was this man, obviously at the very pinnacle of his masculine appeal in his middle thirties, and then there was she.<br><br>He was looking at her with raised eyebrows and smiling eyes.<br><br>"Oh, very well," she said briskly. "But you may live to regret your offer."<br><br>His smile broadened and it seemed to an indignant Claudia that there was no end to this man's appeal. As she had suspected, he had charm oozing from every pore and was therefore not to be trusted one inch farther than she could see him. She would keep a very careful eye upon her two girls during the journey to London.<br><br>"I do hope not, ma'am," he said. "Shall we make an early start?"<br><br>"It is what I intended," she told him. She added grudgingly, "Thank you, Lord Attingsborough. You are most kind."<br><br>"It will be my pleasure, Miss Martin." He bowed deeply again. "May I ask a small favor in return? May I be given a tour of the school? I must confess that the idea of an institution that actually provides an education to girls fascinates me. Lady Whitleaf has spoken with enthusiasm about your establishment. She taught here, I understand."</p><h2>Miracles and Massacres: True and Untold Stories of the Making of America</h2><p><b> HISTORY AS IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE TOLD: TRUE AND THRILLING.</b><br><br>History is about so much more than memorizing facts.

The reason why gun control is so important to government elites can be found in a story about Athens that no one dares teach. Not the city in ancient Greece, but the one in 1946 Tennessee. The power of an individual who trusts his gut can be found in the story of the man who stopped the twentieth hijacker from being part of 9/11. And a lesson on what happens when an all-powerful president is in need of positive headlines is revealed in a story about eight saboteurs who invaded America during World War II.<br> <br><i>Miracles and Massacres</i> is history as you've never heard it told. It's incredible events that you never knew existed. And it's stories so important and relevant to today that you won't have to ask, <i>Why didn't they teach me this? </i>You will instantly know.

Through a subtle and extended examination of Jordan Peele&#x2019;s hit 2017 movie <i><b>Get Out, </b></i>Ko shows the many ways that white supremacist notions of animality and race exist through the consumption and exploitation of flesh. She demonstrates how a critical historical and social understanding of anti-Blackness can provide the pathway to genuine liberation. <br><br>Highly readable, richly illustrated, and full of startling insights, <i><b>Racism as Zoological Witchcraft</b></i> is a brilliant example of the emerging discipline of Black veganism by one of its leading voices.</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Aph Ko</b> is a writer and indie digital media producer.

Cooking for someone is empathy made edible and is a double gift of time - your time to relieve some of their time - and time is one of the greatest gifts you can give. There are chapters with ideas on what to cook for friends or family who are mid-house move, busy with a newborn baby, celebrating a milestone or who just need a little love. Whether it's an aromatic chicken pie made from scratch, or trio of freshly made dips and homemade lavosh biscuits or a sturdy picnic cake, delivered in a basket, for afternoon tea on the riverbank, there are recipes and ideas here to cover every occasion. There is also a chapter dedicated to Christmas with suggestions of food gifts to make and give, as well as recipes for useful things to make and take to friends' houses when invited to dinner or for a weekend away. Every recipe includes information on how to wrap, transport, store (and for how long) and re-heat or serve.

On board one such vessel, the captain&#x2019;s log includes the tusks and legs of elephant herds; rubies, emeralds, topaz; fragrant mountains of cinnamon, cardamom, mustard seeds; forests of ebony, teak, and sandalwood; screeching peacocks; caged and pacing leopards; ten-foot-long monitor lizards whipping their razor tails; barrels of fermented coconut toddy; the jewel-encrusted thrones of Kandyan kings; the weapons of Chola warriors; priceless texts in Pali and Sanskrit, Sinhala and Tamil.</p> <p>At the foam-drenched stern, a blue-eyed, walnut-burnt sahib searches for the vanishing island and says to his pale young wife, &#x201c;A shame, really.

But we are always interlopers into history, dropped into a story that has been going on far before we are born, and so I must start much earlier than my birth and I must start with the boy who will become my father.</p> <p>As the last British ships slip over the horizon, my seven-year-old father-to-be, Nishan, cavorts on beaches he does not know are pristine. He dives into an ocean unpolluted by the gasoline-powered tourist boats of the future.</p> <p>In the months before the thunderous monsoon, the ocean tugs at his toes, wraps sinuous limbs about his own, and pulls him into its embrace, out until it is deep enough to dive, headfirst, feet overhead, inverted and submerged. Eyes open against stinging salt, he sees coral like a crowded, crumbling city, busy with variously marked, spotted, dotted, striped, lit, pompous, and playful sea creatures. Now and then, he encounters the curious, swiveling eye of a small red octopus emerging from secret passageways. Approached recklessly, the octopus blanches a pure white, and with an inky ejaculation torpedoes away. So he learns to approach slowly, in rhythm with the gently rolling water, until the creature coming to know this stick-limbed biped is lulled enough to allow his quiet presence.</p> <p>Farther out beyond the reef, where the coral gives way to the true deep, at a certain time of day a tribe of flat silver fish gather in their thousands. To be there is to be surrounded by living shards of light. At a secret signal, all is chaos, a thousand mirrors shattering about him. Then the school speeds to sea and the boy is left in sedate water, a tug and pull of the body as comfortable as sitting in his father&#x2019;s outspread sarong being sung to sleep.</p> <p>When he emerges dripping from the sea, it is to find this father, the village Ayurvedic doctor, perched on an upturned catamaran, deep in conversation with the fisherfolk who squat on their heels before him.</p> <p>The fishermen wear sarongs splotched with octopus ink. Their hands are leathered by handling rope, mending nets, wrestling sharks by their tails onto the beach. They are ruthless with the flesh of the creatures they catch, upturning gentle sea turtles in the sand to carve off chunks of the living flesh. The turtles bleed slowly, drip salt tears from the corners of their ancient eyes. In this way the meat stays fresh for days, the fishermen explain. For similar reasons the fishermen grasp just caught octopuses and turn them inside out, exposing delicate internals that flash through cycles of color. Decades later, in America, when my father sees Christmas lights for the first time, he will astound us with the observation that they look just like dying octopuses.</p> <p>The sun drops fast, blazing momentarily crimson on the horizon. Father and son wander home. At the front door, his mother, Beatrice Muriel, waits, a lantern in her hand. In her other hand, she grips the shoulder of Nishan&#x2019;s twin sister, Mala, who by dint of her girlhood is not allowed on beach wanderings. Beatrice Muriel ignores her husband. She is angry that they have spent the day with the fisherfolk, listening to fisher songs, picking up fisher habits, coming home covered in beach sand. It is too dark to bathe, she scolds. Cold well water after the sun has set will result in sneezing and a runny nose. &#x201c;Running here and there, like a savage. One day I will find you up a coconut tree with the toddy tappers. That&#x2019;s the day I will skin you alive. Wait and see if I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p> <p>As she scolds, she pulls the bones out of fried fish with deft fingers, mixes it with red rice and coconut sambal into balls, which she pops into the mouths of her children: a bird feeding its chicks. Her monologue ceases only when the plate is empty.</p> <p>Afterward, he goes to sleep on the straw mat next to Mala, sea sand frosting his limbs and gritty in his hair and eyelashes, the dark shapes of his parents on either side of them, their breathing soothing him into sleep.</p> <p>His mother, Beatrice Muriel, comes from a prominent southern family peopled with Vincents, Victorias, Annie-Henriettas, Elizabeths, and Herberts in tribute to the former ruling race. Now, after marriage to the Hikkaduwa Ayurvedic doctor, she is the village schoolteacher. In the small classroom, open to the sea breezes, she teaches the children to read, leads them as they chant loudly an English menagerie: &#x201c;Q IS FOR QUAIL! R IS FOR ROBIN! S IS FOR ESQUIRREL!&#x201d; In the sultry afternoons, she teaches them to work numbers so that they will not be cheated when the Colombo buyers come for fish.</p> <p>Seven years before, Beatrice Muriel, at the age of sixteen, married for a year, finds herself bloodless and nauseous. Her new husband examines her tongue, pulls back her eyelids, nods his head, but propriety will not allow him to name her ailment. Three months later, as custom demands, he sends her home to her mother by swaying bullock cart.</p> <p>In the ancestral house, she is fed and pampered, stroked and coddled. When the pains begin, she labors surrounded by the various women of her family. Her mother parts her thighs, whispers endearments and encouragements into her sweating ears.</p> <p>There are the usual hours of sweat-drenched, pushing, ripping pain before a tiny creature slips forth. A boy! The gods have been benevolent! But wait, Beatrice Muriel on her childhood bed is still sweating, still straining and pushing. With a final effort, a great gush of red, another child slips headfirst from salt water into the wide, airy world. The women submerge the child in the waiting basin of water, hoping to reveal some lighter, more appropriately golden skin tone. The water turns hue, but the baby does not, and Beatrice Muriel, taking in the pair, one eggplant hued and the other milk-tea fair, cries, &#x201c;If only it had been the boy who was so dark! This black-black girl! We will never get her married.&#x201d; To which her mother joins, &#x201c;A darkie granddaughter. Such a shade we have never had in our family. Must be from the father&#x2019;s side!&#x201d; There, revealed for all to see, on the skin of this girl, the stain of low-caste origins. Beatrice Muriel, torn and exhausted from birthing, hangs her head in shame.</p> <p>Because by this time what had not been known before the nuptials has since been revealed. Namely, that sometime in the years before seeking out matrimony, the Doctor had paid a visit to the local registrar&#x2019;s office, where he had worked a sort of alchemy. A handsome bribe to replace his family name, Aposinghe, with its fishy associations and marketplace odors, for the princely sounding Rajasinghe. In this way the Doctor, like so many low-caste persons, had escaped the limitations of fate to win both medical training and wife.</p> <p>The back room of the house is the Doctor&#x2019;s dispensary. On the walls, dusty emerald bottles display their variously oily or transparent contents. On the verandah, patients gather each morning. They are fishermen and farmers who often pay in kind. A large thora fish for the health of a child, a pound of paddy rice for an ointment to ease a grandmother&#x2019;s arthritic knees. The Doctor is dedicated to this motley group of patients, but lacks further ambition and is most satisfied walking the beach with his children.</p> <p>Often Beatrice Muriel finds him in conversation with fishermen, toddy tappers, servants, sometimes even the Tamil coolie who comes to empty the latrine buckets each dawn. When she sees him talking to this blackened djinn who smells of shit and carries the stiff-bristled broom with which he performs his inauspicious duties, it takes all her willpower to walk past them, her stiffly held head eloquent in its disapproval.</p> <p>She has been brought up with definite ideas about the value of each thing and person, its significance and appropriate place on a strict hierarchy. She is unable to tolerate this laxity, her husband&#x2019;s inability or indeed conscious decision not to treat each person according to ancient laws. Her anger takes aim for her husband&#x2019;s head through her children&#x2019;s ears.</p> <p>&#x201c;In my father&#x2019;s day, those people kept out of sight. If one of them had come into the village spreading misfortune and bad smells everywhere, he would have been beaten with his shitty broom. This is your father&#x2019;s fault. Talking to these people. Treating them like every other person. If it were up to him, you know what you all would be doing?&#x201d; Big-eyed children attempt to imagine. &#x201c;You would be gathering up shit with that one. Would you like that? Going door to door in the morning emptying out the buckets of kakka with your hands and a small broom?&#x201d; Children shaking their heads emphatically. No, they would definitely not like that.</p> <p>To counter her husband&#x2019;s carelessness, Beatrice Muriel buys thora fish. She boils it slowly and then pours the water on the thirsty earth of the front yard. She sets the dish in front of her family with great festivity. &#x201c;Now they will know what kind of people we are.&#x201d; Outside, the pungent odor rises. Passersby inhale with distended nostrils and know that the family has feasted on the most expensive sea fish.</p> <p>Those less fortunate eat dried fish while the truly destitute fight with the spiny shells of crabs or lobsters. Decades later, my father will find it incomprehensible that Americans crave what in his childhood was considered repugnant fare. He will look at seafood menus with wonder and shake his head at the truly inexplicable nature of human beings.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>One midnight, the singing of bullfrogs is shattered by human pandemonium. Shouting men burst into the house. They grasp a young fisherman by the arms and legs like a heavy sack of rice, heave him onto the Doctor&#x2019;s table where he writhes and sobs. The family, torn from sleep, witnesses the great, medieval lance skewering the boy&#x2019;s kneecap. The beak of a swordfish, the fishermen say. They had hooked the fish, were reeling it in, when it turned and pierced through the wood and knee as cleanly as if it had aimed exactly for this place. They had to saw through the thing&#x2019;s beak to free him while it smashed itself against the catamaran over and over again. One amputation is rewarded by another. The Doctor must saw through flesh and break through bone by the light of a spluttering kerosene lamp. Outside the window, the entire village gathers, an agitated anthill.</p> <p>Afterward, the fisherman is kept in the dispensary, battling infection, drifting between throbbing pain and dreams of the sea. His name is Seeni Banda and it is Nishan&#x2019;s job to feed him and accompany him to the outhouse. In later years, Seeni Banda will acquire his lifelong companion, the three-legged dog, Kalu Balla, who unlike so many of her four-legged colleagues survives the quiet morning train, losing only a leg to the Doctor&#x2019;s merciful knife.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>For Beatrice Muriel, marriage has not been the pleasant idyll she had been brought up to expect. In an astonishingly short time, the pleasant softness of her body melts away, corroded by relentless sun, salt air, and marital dissatisfaction. Overnight she becomes gaunt, her nostrils pinched, her gaze sharp as knives. She develops the schoolteacher&#x2019;s uncanny ability to detect and subdue childish mischief. Nishan must watch his friends being sent to squat at the back of the schoolroom, arms crossed to grasp opposite ears. As they walk home together, these boys say, &#x201c;<i>Aiyo</i>, she has two eyes in the back of her head.&#x201d; And only filial devotion keeps him from replying, &#x201c;<i>Machang,</i> you should see her at home.&#x201d;</p> <p>Because marital disappointment has bred maternal ambition, Beatrice Muriel dreams of the day her son will enter university and reverse the legacy of a father who is content in daydreams and beach wanderings. Daily, she squats over the open flame, her sari pulled up between her knees, and cooks. Into the fish curry she stirs coconut milk and heady perseverance. Into the sambal, she mixes red onion, green chili, and expectation. Under her breath she mutters invocations to protect her son from <i>as-vaha,</i> the poisonous darts of envy thrown by the gaze of those with less illustrious sons.</p> <p>The days of ocean diving, octopus communing, sand-covered sleep become rare. He spends all his time over books that she has gathered. Head bent over the small pool of light that falls from the lantern, he struggles to memorize English poems and mathematical equations, trace winding Sinhala hieroglyphs. His mother sits by him, her fingers quick with needle and thread. She will not go to sleep until he has finished.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>And now leaving Nishan struggling over his books in the seaside village, we journey northward into the smoky realms of Colombo. Just sixty miles away but a world apart. This is the humid and ...</p></p><h2>Embracing Mind: The Zen Talks of Kobun Chino Otogawa</h2><p>Kobun Chino Otogawa was an instrumental figure in the transmission of Zen to America and its evolution within our culture. Sent from Eiheiji to bring the classical forms of Zen to the First Monastery in America, Kobun arrived as a young man in the midst of a social revolution and resonated in perfect time with the evolution of American Zen. With a refined ability to embody form and a deep belief in Buddha Nature - that the Buddha has no body but ours, Kobun taught Zen with intuitive jazz-like creativity. Although he came to assist Shunryu Suzuki at the San Francisco Zen Center, Kobun was enamored of the way Zen, unfettered, blossomed in new soil and he followed it wherever it grew. For Kobun, Zen was not an institution, but the elemental nature of every aspect of our lives and existed in myriad forms. Kobun founded four temples, taught Buddhism at Stanford and Naropa University, demonstrated and taught Calligraphy and Archery, spoke at events, met with sitting groups in their living rooms and hiked the wilderness with the people he encountered. When Steve Jobs founded Next Computer, Kobun was listed as it&#39;s Spiritual Director. However Zen spoke to a person, be it as a religion, a practice, an aesthetic or a guiding principle, Kobun wholeheartedly believed in Buddha Nature and followed each path with creativity and grace. The wide ranging talks in this book began as Sesshin Teishos - instructions given to students while in the midst of a week-long period of intensive sitting. Together, they offer an insight into the Zen of Kobun Chino Otogawa, containing both his perspective on the forms and his emphasis that Zen is revealed not so much in the sutras as it is in the everyday.</p><p></p><h2>The Plain in Flames (Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long Series in Latin American and Latino Art and Culture)</h2><p><p>Juan Rulfo is one of the most important writers of twentieth-century Mexico, though he wrote only two books&#x2014;the novel Pedro P�ramo (1955) and the short story collection El llano en llamas (1953). First translated into English in 1967 as The Burning Plain, these starkly realistic stories create a psychologically acute portrait of poverty and dignity in the countryside at a time when Mexico was undergoing rapid industrialization following the upheavals of the Revolution. According to Ilan Stavans, the stories' "depth seems almost inexhaustible: with a few strokes, Rulfo creates a complex human landscape defined by desolation. These stories are lessons in morality. . . . They are also astonishing examples of artistic distillation."</p><p>To introduce a new generation of readers to Rulfo's unsurpassable literary talents, this new translation repositions the collection as a classic of world literature. Working from the definitive Spanish edition of El llano en llamas established by the Fundaci�n Juan Rulfo, Ilan Stavans and co-translator Harold Augenbram present fresh translations of the original fifteen stories, as well as two more stories that have not appeared in English before&#x2014;"The Legacy of Matilde Arc�ngel" and "The Day of the Collapse." The translators have artfully preserved the author's "peasantisms," in appreciation of the distinctive voices of his characters. Such careful, elegiac rendering of the stories perfectly suits Rulfo's Mexico, in which people on the edge of despair nonetheless retain a sense of self, of integrity that will not be taken away.</p></p><p>One of today&#x2019;s preeminent essayists, cultural critics, and translators, Ilan Stavans is Lewis-Sebring Professor in Latin American and Latino Culture at Amherst College. His books include The Hispanic Condition; On Borrowed Words; Spanglish; Love and Language; and Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez: The Early Years. He is the editor of The Oxford Book of Jewish Stories; The Poetry of Pablo Neruda; the three-volume set of Isaac Bashevis Singer: Collected Stories; Becoming Americans: Four Centuries of Immigrant Writing; The Norton Anthology of Latino Literature; and The FSG Book of Twentieth-Century Latin American Poetry.<br>A prominent writer, editor, and translator, Harold Augenbraum is the Executive Director of the National Book Foundation. He has published six books on Latino literature.This new translation of a 1953 collection of stories (plus two not previously published in English) from the acclaimed Mexican writer draws readers in with its gritty realism. Each story is told in the first person by characters such as priests and guerilla soldiers, living in the deeply religious and violent countryside of revolutionary Mexico. Rulfo&#39;s characters are imperfect, jaded, and often withhold their confidences until the end of their tales, giving the story the air of a confessional. The harsh and beautiful landscape of the Mexican countryside is personified, with stories taking places in towns like Coraz�n de Maria, translated as the heart of Mary, though in the war-torn country, God is decidedly absent, leaving characters with quiet resignation or haunted despair. The drama spans from the personal, such as in &#34;Talpa,&#34; in which a man drags his dying brother on a long pilgrimage to the Virgen de Talpa with the intention of stealing his wife, to the epic, as in the title story, in which a rebel soldier recounts his five revolutionary years fighting Mexican troops under the command of Pedro Zamora. What is remarkable about these sketches is that the characters are rendered with deep honesty; their faults are highlighted, celebrated in a way that is reminiscent of Chekhov&#39;s peasants. Yet there is tenderness to their portrayal that seems to say: these are what real people are in their entirety. This brand of honesty is striking, and stimulating.

A fragile web of woollen thread on linen, its brilliant colours undimmed after nearly a thousand years, this masterpiece is unique as a complete example of an art form beloved of the aristocracy in the Romanesque era - the `historiated&#39; or narrative embroidery. The momentous story it tells is that of one of the turning-points in English and European history, the struggle for the succession to the English throne which culminated in the Battle of Hastings in the fateful year of 1066. The version told is that of the Normans who commissioned it - of Harold&#39;s perjury and its dreadful price, death and defeat in battle. Yet the sympathies of the English hands that designed and created it are equally evident. And the Tapestry itself is so close to the events it describes, and portrays them in such vivid detail, as to make it in its own right a historical source of the first order, not only for the political crisis of 1064-66 but also for the social history of eleventh-century life.This book presents a full-colour reproduction of the entire Tapestry, with a detailed commentary alongside each episode, equipping the reader to follow the story blow by blow and this marvellous work of art step by step. In addition, a preliminary study sets the Tapestry in its artistic, cultural and historical context. The late Lucien Musset, Emeritus Professor of the University of Caen, studied the Tapestry of nearby Bayeux for nearly fifty years. This erudite but highly readable survey distils a lifetime&#39;s scholarship into a wise and impeccably researched synthesis which enables the modern reader to appreciate what the Tapestry meant in the context of its time, at the start of the last millennium.</p><p>Lucien Musset was Emeritus Professor of the University of Caen.(A) strikingly illustrated book, which reproduces in colour every centimetre of the surviving embroidery.

HOBILAR</p><h2>Japanese Stone Gardens: Origins, Meaning &amp; Form</h2><p><b>Gain some new ideas along with the principles and history of Japanese stone gardening with this useful and beautiful garden design book.</b><br><br><i>Japanese Stone Gardens</i> provides a comprehensive introduction to the powerful mystique and dynamism of the Japanese stone garden&#x2014;from their earliest use as props in animistic rituals, to their appropriation by Zen monks and priests to create settings conducive to contemplation and finally to their contemporary uses and meaning. With insightful text and abundant imagery, this book reveals the hidden order of stone gardens and in the process heightens the enthusiast's appreciation of them.<br><br>The Japanese stone garden is an art form recognized around the globe. These meditative gardens provide tranquil settings, where visitors can shed the burdens and stresses of modern existence, satisfy an age-old yearning for solitude and repose, and experience the restorative power of art and nature. For this reason, the value of the Japanese stone garden today is arguably even greater than when many of them were created. <br><br>Fifteen gardens are featured in this book: some well known, such as the famous temple gardens of Kyoto, others less so, among them gardens spread through the south of Honshu Island and the southern islands of Shikoku and Kyushu and in faraway Okinawa.</p><p><b>Stephen Mansfield</b> is a British writer and photojournalist whose work has appeared in over 60 magazines, newspapers and journals worldwide. He is the author of several books, including <i>Japan: Islands of the Floating World, Japan's Master Gardens</i> and <i>Tokyo: A Biography</i>. He currently resides in Japan, where he is a regular book reviewer for <i>The Japan Times</i>. He has also become an authority on Japanese gardens and has traveled all over Japan to visit and photograph both celebrated and little-known gardens. He recently designed and built a Japanese garden at his home in the outer suburbs of Tokyo, a project that took four seasons to complete. <br><br><b>Donald Richie</b> (1924&#x2013;2013), novelist, essayist, journalist, and film scholar was born in Lima, Ohio, in 1924 but has spent most of the last sixty years witnessing and reporting on the transformation of Japan from postwar devastation to economic powerhouse. He was the author of some forty books of fiction and nonfiction, dozens of speeches and essays, and hundreds of book, film, and arts reviews.The term &#x201c;stone garden&#x201d; may sound like an oxymoron, but in Japan, for time out of mind, people have sensed that stones are charged with life. Considered &#x201c;seats of the gods,&#x201d; stones were placed in &#x201c;purified&#x201d; clearings that became the prototypes for Japan&#x2019;s elegant dry-landscape gardens with their astonishing raked sand patterns. British-born, Japan-residing Mansfield, a versatile writer and photographer and Japanese garden expert, presents an illuminating history of this living art form in sharply focused text and image. He traces the influences of Shintoism, Taoism, and, most significantly, Zen Buddhism, and artfully delineates the aesthetics of stone, sand, and gravel arranged to embrace and transcend nature, embody impermanence and stillness, and inspire contemplation and serenity. By creating a vivid social context for the evolution of stone gardens over the centuries and portraying seminal master gardeners, Mansfield vitalizes this seemingly austere tradition.

Most contemporary scientists and philosophers believe that reality is at bottom purely physical, and that human beings are nothing more than extremely complicated biological machines. On such views our everyday experiences of conscious decision-making, free will, and the self are illusory by-products of the grinding of our neural machinery. It follows that mind and personality are necessarily extinguished at death, and that there exists no deeper transpersonal or spiritual reality of any sort.<br><br>Beyond Physicalism is the product of an unusual fellowship of scientists and humanities scholars who dispute these views. In their previous publication, Irreducible Mind, they argued that physicalism cannot accommodate various well-evidenced empirical phenomena including paranormal or psi phenomena, postmortem survival, and mystical experiences. In this new theory-oriented companion volume they go further by attempting to understand how the world must be constituted in order that these &#x201c;rogue&#x201d; phenomena can occur. Drawing upon empirical science, metaphysical philosophy, and the mystical traditions, the authors work toward an improved &#x201c;big picture&#x201d; of the general character of reality, one which strongly overlaps territory traditionally occupied by the world&#x2019;s institutional religions, and which attempts to reconcile science and spirituality by finding a middle path between the polarized fundamentalisms, religious and scientific, that have dominated recent public discourse.<br><br>Contributions by: Harald Atmanspacher, Loriliai Biernacki, Bernard Carr, Wolfgang Fach, Michael Grosso, Michael Murphy, David E.

It has resulted in [a] mammoth work . . . Beyond Physicalism &#x2013; a volume that not only provides much food for thought but is in itself a feast of thinking. (<i>Network Review</i>)<br><br>Beyond Physicalism presents a serious challenge to physicalism from psychologists, neuroscientists, physicists, philosophers, and Eastern scholars. This volume is no 'New Age' pap with easy answers, but it carefully considers so far intractable issues; and, it demands careful and repeated readings. . . .Beyond Physicalism should interest readers who are willing to consider the intricacies and extraordinary nature of consciousness, rather than dismissing them offhand. No doubt some of the ideas covered in the book will be shown to be limited . . . but they seek to provide a comprehensive explanation of mind and matter that has been lacking in most discussions until now. Beyond Physicalism does not offer a definitive theory, but it describes serious alternatives to materialism. The appropriate reply by the holders of the latter position should be not to ignore the phenomena explained by these alternatives, as they have usually done so far, but to advance a better materialist position to explain them. Will they take up the gauntlet? (<i>PsycCRITIQUES</i>)<br><br>[T]his is an excellent book on the subject[.] (<i>De Numine</i>)<br><br>Beyond Physicalism heralds an impending shift of epic proportion in humankind's efforts to understand the nature of reality, and potentially the most significant advance in the recent history of the mind-body debate. This landmark book provides an unprecedented synthesis of science, psychology, philosophy and theology, approaching the deeper truth of all existence. (Eben Alexander III, MD, Neurosurgeon and author of Proof of Heaven and The Map of Heaven)<br><br>Finally, a book that conclusively demonstrates that it is possible, in fact preferable, to reconcile genuine science with spirituality. Drawing upon a massive amount of compelling empirical data, and weaving together several interrelated and extremely thoughtful theoretical perspectives offered by a range of highly respected scientists and humanists, Beyond Physicalism articulates a cogent and compelling alternative to the distorted &#x201c;all or nothing&#x201d; dichotomy between a narrow-minded religious fundamentalism and an equally dogmatic and rigid scientistic mentality.

(William Eastman, former director of SUNY Press)<br><br>In this wonderful sequel to Irreducible Mind: Toward a Psychology for the 21st Century, "rogue" phenomena that are the essential facts denied by psychology too long mired in varieties of physicalism are rightly accepted as empirical fact. Abandoning neither the truths of science nor those of religion, evolutionary panentheism provides the tertium quid that that can steer us safely home. This is a must read book. Marvelous! (Ralph W. Hood Jr., professor of Psychology, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and former editor, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion)<br><br>Dogmatic materialists, sometimes called skeptics, claim that to accept the possibility of any non-physical force or entity requires that we sacrifice all of modern science. No matter the apparent evidence, we are told, the future of scientific progress and rationality are at stake. Creationism and the flat Earth lie in wait. Beyond Physicalism, however, presents both solid empirical evidence and fully rational theoretical views demonstrating that the materialist&#x2019;s dichotomy is false. This book offers a third way, reconciling science and spirituality without diluting either. Robust and evidence-based, this work by highly respected scholars and scientists demolishes orthodoxies right and left, allowing the reader a way forward past the Scylla and Charybdis of religious and scientific fundamentalisms. (David J. Hufford, professor emeritus, Penn State College of Medicine.)<br><br>Beyond Physicalism&#x201d; is much more than a book.

My first teachers each had a vast magickal library, with both the popular, modern books and the classic magickal texts, the old grimoires of Solomon and the medieval books of occult philosophies. I thumbed through these old books and must admit that, even though they were written in old-style English, they might as well have been written in Greek, Latin, or Hebrew, because I didn't really understand them. These books contained various alphabets, codices of spirits to summon for a variety of purposes, and the consecration of ritual tools with bizarre and seemingly impractical ingredients. Most of them had a strong Christian slant to them. I didn't know why my witchcraft teachers had them or how they could be used. The whole topic of medieval magick seemed a little beyond me, yet it fascinated me. It was like a grammar school student picking up a college textbook, knowing there were important things in it but lacking the context to understand it. In witchcraft training, we learned bits and pieces of information associated with the Qabalah, tarot, Rosicrucian breathing exercises, and Hermetic philosophy, but we didn't understand the systems that wove them all together. I was told that they were "high magick" and that perhaps someday I would take an interest in the subject. At the time, I didn't think so. But eventually I did.</p> <p>I got so interested in this form of high magick that I almost put my witchcraft practice on the back burner. I sought out a lot of the classic magickal texts and puzzled over them. Soon I met an amazing man who had much more information and practical experience with high magick, who explained to me the rituals of high magick, also known as <em>ceremonial magick</em>, in terms of my more traditional witchcraft. He introduced me to modern books that dissected the old texts and distilled their wisdom into a more digestible format. I soon noticed the similarities between the workings of the witch and those of the ceremonial magician. The circle, the four watchtowers, the summoning of spirits and angels, and the use of elemental and planetary correspondences are common to both. I could see the influence of high magick on my own tradition of witchcraft in the very structure and words of the rituals. I learned that some initiatory traditions of witchcraft train their students extensively in the arts of high magick. I never had this training, so I sought it out on my own. As I researched, I learned that many of the modern Craft founders had some knowledge of or involvement in high magick, and that the histories of both witchcraft and high magick were deeply interwoven. One might say that the modern forefathers of the Craft relied heavily on the knowledge preserved in the ceremonial manuscripts. It is only natural that one complements the other. Though seen as two separate traditions now, they most likely have a similar spiritual, if not historical, origin.</p> <p>Older witchcraft books written in the twentieth century-not by New Age practitioners writing for practitioners but by those authors collecting folk history, charms, and esoteric pictures-never fail to include information on alchemy, Qabalah, spirit summoning, tarot, and many notable ceremonial magicians, including Cornelius Agrippa, John Dee, Eliphas L�vi, Aleister Crowley and the members of the Golden Dawn, in their descriptions of the history and practice of witchcraft. These books, not having practical instructions or modern spells, were less popular among new practitioners, but they point out a valuable part of our history that many modern witches ignore.</p> <p>With this tutor's help, I began to integrate the practices of high magick into my own spiritual working. Knowledge of the Qabalah, and the Tree of Life, gave me a more detailed framework in which I could place my experiences, correspondences, and theology. This integral symbol of the Western magickal mysteries gave me a working model that detailed the universe with more depth than I had previously understood. It gave me a context for my own spiritual awakenings on the path. I found this new knowledge invaluable, and in the end, it only served to deepen my devotion to the Goddess and God and my practice of witchcraft as a tradition of spiritual evolution.</p> <p>Ceremonial magick gave me a range of knowledge and understanding that expanded my worldview. The use of many cultural associations, from the mysteries of the East to alchemy and the ancient mysteries of Egypt and Greece, opened me up to a worldview of magick. Even the Judeo-Christian associations helped heal my division from my birth religion and allowed me to recognize and honor the mystic traditions in both of those mainstream faiths, even if they were not for me in this lifetime.</p> <p>As I eventually took on students of my own and began teaching my traditions to others, I struggled to present this material to my circle of modern eclectic witches. The mysteries of ceremonial magick often frighten the witch. They are seen as too male, too intellectual, too complicated, formal, and stuffy. People want freedom and creativity, and I do too, but I found in my study of music and art that when you seriously pursue something and want to know all about it, you have to learn the rules first in order to know how to break them and still be effective. In music training, you learn all the theory, how the classical composers did things, and the evolution of music. In the modern era, we have the freedom to compose anything we want, in any manner we want, but some of the best modern compositions come from those who have studied and integrated the classics. You have to know, as a tradition, where you have been, where your roots are, in order to know where you are going. Then you have the freedom and knowledge to adapt things, and do so effectively. A lot of people do rituals with no rules, no structure, no theory, and then wonder why their spells don't work. Part of training in any art, if you hope to be a part of its present and future, is having enough respect for the tradition to know where it comes from and how it has evolved. I have studied art, music, and now magick, and have found this to be true of all three disciplines.</p> <p>When I shared with my peers the books I was studying and working from, I got mostly blank stares or jokes. When I asked if they had read up on ceremonial magick, most had not. They didn't know what they were missing, even to find out that it wasn't for them. They didn't seek out new horizons and challenge their perceptions and understanding of magick. There will come a point in your magickal training when you will want to know about all forms of magick, even if you don't practice them. I wanted to be educated about magick. I wanted to know why my teachers had the medieval grimoires on their shelves. The wise witches I knew had an understanding of this brand of magick, even if they didn't practice ceremonial magick as their main tradition.</p> <p>Many people would not consider ceremonial magick to be under the heading of witchcraft, but the more I studied, the more I realized, using my wide definition of witchcraft, that the ceremonial arts are one of the main branches of the Craft. We can see our ancestors in the ceremonial priestesses and priests of the ancient civilizations. In my own curriculum, I soon included high magick as the fourth branch of training and corresponded it to the element of air, the element of the magician, the Mercury archetype, for it's all about our thoughts, perceptions, and communication.</p> <p>The first level, outlined in the first book in this series, <em>The Inner Temple of Witchcraft</em>, corresponds to the fire element and the inner spark of psychic development. The second level of training, found in <em>The Outer Temple of Witchcraft</em>, is associated with the earth element, focusing on the natural cycles, the four elements, spellcraft, and the magick circle ritual. The third level of training, encompassed in <em>The Temple of Shamanic Witchcraft</em>, covers the shamanic practices of the witch and focuses on the element of water, reflections, shadow work, and crossing the veil between the physical and spiritual worlds. The book in your hands, the fourth in the series, can be used on its own as a study of high magick in the context of witchcraft or as part of the continuing education in the Temple of Witchcraft series of books. There are some exercises in <em>The Temple of High Witchcraft </em>that require information from the previous texts or that refer to more information in those books for a deeper understanding and connection; these are abbreviated as <em>ITOW</em>, <em>OTOW</em>, and <em>TOSW</em>, respectively, with a chapter or exercise number listed.</p> <p><em>The Temple of High Witchcraft </em>is a distillation of my own experiences and explorations in ceremonial magick. It is a workbook for your own study, based on the course I offer my own students. It starts with four introductory chapters, to better understand the background of the lesson material. These four chapters are followed by twelve lessons, each with exercises, rituals, and homework, to be explored in a year and a day, as is traditional for witchcraft training. The thirteenth lesson culminates in a ritual initiation fusing the traditions of witchcraft and high magick through exploring your own views and understanding of the universe.</p> <p>This fourth level is much like the graduate studies of witchcraft for my students. It exposes them to a larger worldview than what is offered in most witchcraft books, much like higher education exposes students to a diverse range of topics, cultures, and people. This course challenges students' beliefs, perceptions, and symbolism in their own magick and in their own life. One of the key words of the element of air is <em>life</em>, the breath of life, for it is through our air elemental energy that we perceive and seek to know the mysteries of life.</p> <p>Each level of training presents a challenge. The Inner Temple's challenge is to awaken, to realize that life is magickal and you carry the spark of flame within you. The Outer Temple's challenge is to harmonize with the natural forces, usually through the cycles and seasons, to manifest the life you want. The Temple of Shamanic Witchcraft's challenge is emotional in nature, to find and face the shadow self and take responsibility for all that you have repressed. This fourth challenge is one of intellect, to stretch perceptions and step out of belief systems, and to find which thoughts and beliefs serve your spiritual evolution and which ones must be discarded or transformed. Ultimately, you will see your beliefs and models as tools rather than absolute truth.</p> <p>The sword, blade, or athame is the tool of air, and in tarot cards, the suit of swords presents the most challenges, at least with only a casual observation. Most of the sword cards don't look happy. They present challenges, conflicts, and miscommunications. In the outer world, they are perceived as challenges involving other people. In the inner world, they represent the conflict of the mind, of all aspects of the mind&#x2015;our beliefs, thoughts, images, and preconceived notions that are in conflict with each other. The swords present the most problems because the mind is the inner tool, the gift that presents us with so many challenges. The body, heart, and soul all have their challenges, but the mind can be the most problematic. We learn to quiet the mind through meditation and ritual, and to see things from a different perspective, but as human beings, we still get caught up in our beliefs, in the zones of comfort that our mind holds, and feel threatened and challenged by new ideas or points of view. The job of the sword is to cut to the truth. But your truth is not necessarily my truth. Your truth is only one aspect of universal truth.</p> <p>It is the job of the guardians of the air element, the Mercurial archetypal beings who often manifest as trickster spirits, to "trick" us out of our minds and see things from a new point of view. We soon realize that a point of view is just that&#x2015;one way of looking at things&#x2015;and that there are many ways, all with merit, to look at the universe, magick, and spirituality. It's no coincidence that many of these trickster deities are also magicians. They are sages, scribes, and tutors in the magickal arts, but they are not always easy on us or kind. In the realm of Mercury we find the Egyptian Thoth; the Sumerian Nabu; the Norse Odin and his more maligned counterpart Loki; the Greek Hermes and the Roman Mercury; Merlin, the wild man magician; the African Legba, keeper of the doorways; and the Native American Coyote and Raven. Each reveals the mysteries, showing us that things are not always as they appear. They are the gods of magick, for the foundation of magick is a change in perception.</p> <p>One of my favorite folk tales involves a trickster god. One version says this god is Odin, while others give credit to the Nigerian god Eshu. The god walks down the road that bisects the village wearing a special hat. The hat is colored red on one side and blue on the other. He turns his hat around and then walks back through the village. When people gather together and say, "Did you see the god in the blue hat?," his neighbor responds with, "No, no, he had a red hat on his head." Then they argue and fight. When two of the men who are brawling are taken before the king for judgment for their crime, the trickster god appears before them all and says, "It's my fault. I did it, and I meant to do it. Spreading strife is my greatest joy."</p> <p>The two different views of god created two different paradigms, one based in blue and one in red. This is a metaphor for how many views we have of divinity. We each connect to the same source, the same power, yet come away with a different impression. Neither is completely correct. The trickster comes by and says, "You're both right. And you're both wrong." You can never have the whole picture of divinity while you are in this life. Spiritual traditions are just a point of view, a perspective on the whole. Our religions, and even our magickal systems, are just like looking at the god in the hat. They are just a model, a point of view, and not the ultimate truth. We have problems when anyone who believes that his or her perspective is <em>the</em> perspective and the only way. We then get into dogma and fundamentalism. Even in paganism, magick, and New Age traditions, we can find the same fundamentalism we see in the mainstream institutional religions. The trickster's role is to challenge us to get beyond it. His strife causes us to grow, change, and expand our point of view to include both colors of the hat. In witchcraft we have the model of the wheel of life, with forces rising and ascending, creating times of prosperity and peace and times of strife and blight, both of which are needed for the turning of the wheel. The wisdom is found in how we respond to the turning of the wheel.</p> <p>If you are looking for a tradition to give you the "way," then witchcraft, or ceremonial magick, is probably not for you. In each, there are many permutations. We honor the t...</p></p><h2>The New Hunger: A Warm Bodies Novella (Warm Bodies Series, The)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;In rich, evocative prose, Marion transports his readers back into the postapocalyptic parable he first brought to life&#x2014;or death&#x2014;in his brilliant debut <i>Warm Bodies</i>.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i> (starred review)</b><br> <br><b>&#x201c;Refreshingly unique...I love this novella.&#x201d;</b> &#x2014;<b>LitStack</b><br> <br><b>The must-read prequel to the &#x201c;highly original&#x201d; (<i>The</i> <i>Seattle Times</i>) <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Warm Bodies&#x2014;</i>now a major motion picture&#x2014;from the author whose genre-defying debut turned the classic horror story on its head.</b><br><br>The end of the world didn&#x2019;t happen overnight.<br> <br>After years of societal breakdowns, wars and quakes and rising tides, humanity was already near the edge.

Under programs that ran into the 1970s, more than 250,000 children were separated from their families, although many of them were merely unwanted orphans, truants, or delinquents. <br> <i>The State Boys Rebellion</i> conveys the shocking truth about America's eugenic era through the experiences of a group of boys held at the Fernald State School in Massachusetts starting in the late 1940s. In the tradition of <i>Erin Brockovich,</i> it recounts the boys' dramatic struggle to demand their rights and secure their freedom. It also covers their horrifying discovery many years later that they had been fed radioactive oatmeal in Cold War experiments -- and the subsequent legal battle that ultimately won them a multimillion-dollar settlement. <br> Meticulously researched through school archives, previously sealed papers, and interviews with the surviving State Boys, this deft expos� is a powerful reminder of the terrifying consequences of unchecked power as well as an inspiring testament to the strength of the human spirit.</p><p><b>Michael D'Antonio</b> is the author of many acclaimed books, including <i>Atomic Harvest, Fall from Grace, Tin Cup Dreams, Mosquito, </i>and <i>The State Boys Rebellion. </i>His work has also appeared in <i>Esquire, The New York Times Magazine, Los Angeles Times Magazine, Discover, </i>and many other publications. Among his many awards is the Pulitzer Prize, which he shared with a team of reporters for <i>Newsday.</i><b>Chapter One</b> <p> The snow stopped at about three o'clock in the afternoon. Four boys, aged six and seven, pulled on coats, boots, hats, and woolen mittens and scuffled out to the barn, where a wooden toboggan was propped against a wall. They grabbed the sled and headed for the coasting hill, which was a quarter-mile away, through a leaf-bare apple orchard and a stand of pine trees. The cold froze their breath, and the snow muffled the sound of their voices as they argued over who would get the first ride. </p><p> When they got to the hill, Freddie, Gordon, Wally, and Foxy stopped for a moment and looked down the slope toward Hoyt's dairy farm. (Freddie, the smallest and youngest of the boys, was frightened by the steep incline, but he didn't show his fear to the others.) In the distance, where the slope ran out, the property line was marked by a stream called Silver Brook, and by twisted strands of rusted barbed wire strung on three-foot-high posts. </p><p> On the first few runs, the toboggan barely made it through the fluffy powder to the bottom. But as they kept at it, sliding down the same path and trudging up beside it, the boys made a track of packed snow. The toboggan flew faster with each trip down. It also ran a few feet farther, toward the stream. </p><p> As dusk fell, the boys' cheeks turned red, and they panted as they climbed the hill. Pea-sized clumps of snow hung from their soggy mittens and collected on their socks. Their toes and their ears were numb, but under wool caps their hair was soaked with sweat. They had orders to be home by dark, so there was time for just one more ride. Gordon and Wally climbed onto the toboggan behind Freddie, who had already tucked himself under the sled's curved wooden front. Foxy gave them a big push. </p><p> With the air growing colder by the second, the track was turning to ice. As the toboggan hurtled forward, Wally and Gordon realized that it was not going to stop before they got to Silver Brook. They tumbled out and yelled for Freddie to jump. Freddie didn't respond. When he finally stirred, it was to lean to the side, steering the sled away from the brook and into the barbed-wire fence. </p><p> Freddie's face was so numb from the cold that he didn't feel any pain when the rusted barb caught his right cheek. But he did feel a pull, like the tug a fish must feel from a hook and line. When his flesh tore, the wire snapped free. The toboggan skidded to a stop. Freddie rolled out and then sat up. He looked down to see red drops on the snow. The other boys, who had run down the hill, pulled him to his feet and began to walk him back up the slope. </p><p> When they reached the barn, the warm blood finally thawed Freddie's face and the nerve cells in his cheek began to scream. He cried and the boys shouted for help. Inside the house, sixty-seven-year-old Marion Bond heard them and went to the door. She brought the boys inside, put a hot, wet cloth to Freddie's cheek, and told him to hold it there, firmly, while she telephoned for a doctor. By the time she returned, Freddie was still in pain, but he was more concerned about what Mrs. Bond was going to say and do. She sat down on a chair and hugged him hard, trapping the wet cloth between his face and her breast. He noticed she was warm and smelled like soap. When she let him go, she continued to press the bandage against his cheek, to stop the bleeding. The room smelled like wet wool and sweaty boys. </p><p> Freddie didn't cry when the doctor arrived and tugged the blood-encrusted cloth away from his wound. He stood bravely as his skin was stitched closed, and he even stayed calm for a tetanus shot. Freddie had always had the ability to retreat into his mind, shutting out whatever physical or emotional pain was at hand. This skill allowed him to feel good about the attention he was receiving. He would forever remember the doctor's visit and his run-in with the barbed wire as a positive experience. The warm cloth, Mrs. Bond's embrace, and even the doctor's needle felt like love. </p><p> Frederick Boyce had followed a loveless path to the Bond farm on Hadley Road in rural Merrimac, Massachusetts. He had been born in Boston on January 12, 1941, to a mother who had just turned twenty-one. A short, skinny, dark-haired woman with little education, Mina Boyce had drifted through life, transferring her dependency from one unreliable man to another. When Freddie arrived, she already had one child, a two-year-old named Joseph, who state records noted was "illegitimate." She had a problem with alcohol, and she was a widow. Her husband, a steamfitter from rural Maine, had committed suicide before her second child's birth. </p><p> Mina had held on to her sons until August of 1941, when neighbors called police because the children had been left alone in her apartment in Boston. Social workers from the state's Department of Public Welfare came with the police, who broke open the locked door. The officials took custody of the children, placing them with separate foster families who were overseen by the department's Division of Child Guardianship. Frederick, who would never see Joseph again, landed in a foster home in the small town of South Easton, about thirty miles south of Boston. There, under the care of Mrs. Kathleen Brophy, he survived bouts of grippe and scarlet fever. He learned to walk and talk, but speech came slowly. He could say just a handful of words. Small and thin for his age, Freddie had dark skin, brown eyes, and thick curly hair that was turning from light to dark brown. </p><p> The house in South Easton was filled with kids. Some, like Freddie, were wards of the state. Others were Mrs. Brophy's biological children. She kept control with harsh discipline and threats. Like most children, Freddie learned the power of saying no at age two. He tried it out a few times with Mrs. Brophy, and she warned him against it. He became much more cooperative when he saw her snatch up a very young child who had wet his pants and dunk him, feet-first, in a flushing toilet. The punishment was designed to teach the children about the importance of potty training and obedience. Freddie got the message. </p><p> As an adult, Fred Boyce would recall that in the Brophy home the state wards ate separately from the family. Their diet was heavy on spaghetti, potatoes, and cereal, and light on meat, milk, and eggs. Freddie never got enough, except once. It happened on a night when other boys had sneaked into the kitchen and stolen food. When they were caught, Freddie was awakened, brought to the kitchen, and required to eat a large meal while the others looked on. Confused and frightened, he gobbled the food quickly and then threw up. </p><p> In the two years that he lived with Kathleen Brophy, Freddie grew into an active toddler, but he was especially shy. Though he didn't understand why he received less attention than Mrs. Brophy's biological children, he surely felt the difference. He seemed afraid to talk to adults, and other children had trouble understanding him. He breathed heavily, and at night he snored like an old man. These problems improved when he had his tonsils removed. A few months later, he made his first visit to a barber, where his soft, brown curls were cut off. The next time a social worker visited him, she noted that "he has lost his babyish look." </p><p> State records show no reason, but Freddie was moved to another home, this one in the town of Hingham, in October of 1944. Two days after Christmas, when a social worker came to that house, Freddie ran to hide, afraid he was to be uprooted again. He was right. The "state lady," as he called her, packed his clothes into paper sacks and brought him, resisting all the way, out of the house to a car. She put him in the back seat, along with his things, and drove away. In an hour, he was at yet another foster home -- his third -- in the town of Dedham. A few days after his arrival, he turned four years old. </p><p> The new foster mother, Margaret Forrester, worried about Freddie's speech problems. Though he seemed aware of everything that was said, he spoke in a strange, tight-mouthed way that was often unintelligible. Among the few words he said clearly were "cat" and "mama" and "barber." (Evidently, that first haircut had made a big impression on him.) For the first time, a social worker recorded a note that suggested that this skinny dark-haired boy with penetrating eyes was not being well served by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She wrote: </p><p> </p><blockquote>Foster mother: Frederick was in bad shape when she got him. He was thin. Child would sit for hours without moving, and she discovered that he had some sores on his head.</blockquote> <p> Freddie stayed nearly three years in this place, making his first true friend -- a boy named Robert -- and showing his foster mother that he was bright, even advanced for his age. He cleared the table after meals, dusted Mrs. Forrester's living room when she asked him to, and helped to watch after the younger children. He understood complex instructions and was a peacemaker with the other boys when things got rowdy. Still, his garbled speech troubled adults. A social worker reported: </p><p> </p><blockquote>Foster mother persuaded F. to sing a song. He did this by barely opening his mouth.</blockquote> <p> Based on caseworker recommendations, the state sent Fred to a physician who found him capable of talking, but reluctant to engage in extended conversations, and he predicted the boy would "grow out of it" without any special help. Otherwise, the doctor found that Freddie was a normal boy. </p><p> The social workers assigned to his case did not accept the doctor's evaluation of Freddie Boyce. Still troubled by his speech, they were determined to discover the cause of his problem. In July of 1946, a state lady took him to an institution for the retarded in Wrentham for testing. (Located in the town by the same name, the Wrentham State School was about five miles northeast of the Massachusetts border with Rhode Island and a half-hour's drive from Mrs. Forrester's home in Dedham.) </p><p> For the intelligence test, he was required to repeat five-digit numbers, to define words such as "timid" and "tame," to na...</p></p><h2>The Doing of the Thing: The Brief, Brilliant Whitewater Career of Buzz Holmstrom (New Edition)</h2><p>Biography of America&#39;s great river runner, Buzz Holmstrom: the first to run the Green and Colorado Rivers alone in 1937.

While working as a marriage counselor for more than 30 years, he identified five love languages: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch. In a friendly, often humorous style, he unpacks each one. Some husbands or wives may crave focused attention; another needs regular praise. Gifts are highly important to one spouse, while another sees fixing a leaky faucet, ironing a shirt, or cooking a meal as filling their "love tank." Some partners might find physical touch makes them feel valued: holding hands, giving back rubs, and sexual contact. Chapman illustrates each love language with real-life examples from his counseling practice. <p> How do you discover your spouse&#x2019;s &#x2013; and your own &#x2013; love language? Chapman&#x2019;s short questionnaires are one of several ways to find out. Throughout the book, he also includes application questions that can be answered more extensively in the beautifully detailed companion leather journal (an exclusive Amazon.com set).

The play is set in a beach bungalow. The young man who lives there has pulled a lost young woman from the ocean. Soon, she finds herself trapped in his life and torn between her need to come to rest somewhere and her certainty that all human relationships turn eventually into nightmares. The struggle between his tolerant and gently ironic approach to life and her strategy of suspicion and attack becomes a kind of war about love and creation which neither can afford to lose. This is an offbeat, wonderful love story. Note: The play contains a wealth of excellent monologue and scene material.</p></p><p></p><h2>Surgical Equipment and Supplies</h2><p><p><strong>Enter the OR with confidence</strong></p><p>Here&#x2019;s your go-to guide to the vast array of surgical instruments and equipment used in the OR today.

Stephen Stigler sets forth the seven foundational ideas of statistics&#x2015;a scientific discipline related to but distinct from mathematics and computer science.</p><p>Even the most basic idea&#x2015;<i>aggregation</i>, exemplified by averaging&#x2015;is counterintuitive. It allows one to gain information by discarding information, namely, the individuality of the observations. Stigler&#x2019;s second pillar, <i>information measurement, </i>challenges the importance of &#x201c;big data&#x201d; by noting that observations are not all equally important: the amount of information in a data set is often proportional to only the square root of the number of observations, not the absolute number. The third idea is <i>likelihood</i>, the calibration of inferences with the use of probability. <i>Intercomparison</i> is the principle that statistical comparisons do not need to be made with respect to an external standard. The fifth pillar is <i>regression</i>, both a paradox (tall parents on average produce shorter children; tall children on average have shorter parents) and the basis of inference, including Bayesian inference and causal reasoning. The sixth concept captures the importance of <i>experimental design</i>&#x2015;for example, by recognizing the gains to be had from a combinatorial approach with rigorous randomization. The seventh idea is the <i>residual</i>: the notion that a complicated phenomenon can be simplified by subtracting the effect of known causes, leaving a residual phenomenon that can be explained more easily.</p><p><i>The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom</i> presents an original, unified account of statistical science that will fascinate the interested layperson and engage the professional statistician.</p></p><p>Stephen M. Stigler is Ernest DeWitt Burton Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago.&#x201c;The hardest kind of scientific thinking concerns what&#x2019;s in a field&#x2019;s basement&#x2015;and Stigler has brought a bright flashlight to his subterranean investigations of the ever-more-influential field of statistics.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Bradley Efron, Stanford University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Distilled from centuries of statistical research and garnished with wit, this masterfully prepared seven-course food for thought is a real treat for anyone who wants to reason with data, big or small.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Xiao-Li Meng, Harvard University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Statistics has a core set of ideas that touch every aspect of our lives.

As Gu�non points out, the cross is one of the most universal of all symbols and is far from belonging to Christianity alone. Indeed, Christians have sometimes tended to lose sight of its symbolical significance and to regard it as no more than the sign of a historical event. By restoring to the cross its full spiritual value as a symbol, but without in any way detracting from its historical importance for Christianity, Gu�non has performed a task of inestimable importance which perhaps only he, with his unrivalled knowledge of the symbolic languages of both East and West, was qualified to perform. Although The Symbolism of the Cross is one of Gu�non&#39;s core texts on traditional metaphysics, written in precise, nearly &#39;geometrical&#39; language, vivid symbols are necessarily pressed into service as reference points-how else could the mind ascend the ladder of analogy to pure intellection? Gu�non applies these doctrines more concretely elsewhere in critiquing modernity in such works as The Crisis of the Modern World and The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times, and invokes them also to help explain the nature of initiation and of initiatic organizations in such works as Perspectives on Initiation and Initiation and Spiritual Realization.</p><p>"The Collected Works of Ren� Gu�non brings together the writings of one of the greatest prophets of our time, whose voice is even more important today than when he was alive." --Huston Smith, author of The World&#x2019;s Religions, etc.Ren� Gu�non (1886&#x2013;1951) was one of the great luminaries of the twentieth century, whose critique of the modern world has stood fast against the shifting sands of intellectual fashion. His extensive writings, now finally available in English, are a providential treasure-trove for the modern seeker: while pointing ceaselessly to the perennial wisdom found in past cultures ranging from the Shamanistic to the Indian and Chinese, the Hellenic and Judaic, the Christian and Islamic, and including also Alchemy, Hermeticism, and other esoteric currents, they direct the reader also to the deepest level of religious praxis, emphasizing the need for affiliation with a revealed tradition even while acknowledging the final identity of all spiritual paths as they approach the summit of spiritual realization. Ren� Gu�non, of whom Jacob Needleman wrote in The Sword of Gnosis that &#x2018;no other modern writer has so effectively communicated the absoluteness of truth,&#x2019; is gradually being recognized by deeper thinkers as one of the few who have truly penetrated the seductive veil of the modern age. As an expositor of pure metaphysics and its application to the science of symbols, Gu�non is without peer; and his extraordinarily prescient critique of the modern world is attracting more and more attention among cultural commentators. Little known in the English-speaking world till the recent appearance of his Collected Works in translation, Gu�non has nevertheless long been recognized as a veritable criterion of truth by a vanguard of remarkable writers who evince that rare combination: intellectuality and spirituality. After a lonely childhood, often interrupted by ill health, Gu�non navigated the seductive half-truths of occultism toward a deeper, unified vision offering a way out from the confusion and fragmentation of our time. Regarded by leading scholars as the first truly authentic interpreter of many Eastern doctrines in the West, Gu�non never tired, in face of the seemingly inexorable process of dissolution in the twentieth century, of pointing to the transcendent unity of all religious faiths and the abiding Truth that contains them all.</p><h2>Life Together and Prayerbook of the Bible (Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works)</h2><p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, one of the most influential Christian martyrs in history, bequeathed to humanity a legacy of theological creativity and spirituality that continues to intrigue people from a variety of backgrounds. Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, a sixteen volume series, offers a fresh, critical translation of Bonhoeffer&#39;s writings, with introductions, annotations, and interpretations. The stimulus for the writing of Life Together was the closing of the preacher&#39;s seminary at Finkenwalde. The treatise contains Bonhoeffer&#39;s thoughts about the nature of Christian community based on the common life that he and his seminarians experienced at the seminary and in the &#34;Brother&#39;s House&#34; there.

"If?anyone can make it [Operations Research] understandably readable and positively interesting it is Stafford Beer ? everyone in management ? should be grateful to him for using clear and at times elegant English and ? even elegant diagrams." The Economist <p>Based on the Massey Lectures, this book examines the reasons why the institutions of our society may well be failing, and opens a discussion as to what could be done. Drawing on the science of effective organization, which is his definition of cybernetics, Stafford Beer explains key cybernetic principles in words and pictures that all can understand. He concludes that our society commits more and more resources to plastering over the cracks in the system?which simply reappear?while freedom itself is increasingly eroded. The institutions must be redesigned, and returned to the people, to whom the scientific tools for doing this ought to belong.</p><b>Stafford Beer</b>, an international consultant in the sciences of management and effective organization, wrote hundreds of papers and articles and five books, among them <i>Decision and Control</i>, <i>Management Science</i>, and <i>Platform for Change</i>.

But Susan Ware uncovered a much broader and more diverse story waiting to be told. <i>Why They Marched</i> is a tribute to the many women who worked tirelessly in communities across the nation, out of the spotlight, protesting, petitioning, and insisting on their right to full citizenship.</p><p>Ware tells her story through the lives of nineteen activists, most of whom have long been overlooked. We meet Mary Church Terrell, a multilingual African American woman; Rose Schneiderman, a labor activist building coalitions on New York&#x2019;s Lower East Side; Claiborne Catlin, who toured the Massachusetts countryside on horseback to drum up support for the cause; Mary Johnston, an aristocratic novelist bucking the Southern ruling elite; Emmeline W. Wells, a Mormon woman in a polygamous marriage determined to make her voice heard; and others who helped harness a groundswell of popular support. We also see the many places where the suffrage movement unfolded&#x2015;in church parlors, meeting rooms, and the halls of Congress, but also on college campuses and even at the top of Mount Rainier. Few corners of the United States were untouched by suffrage activism.</p><p>Ware&#x2019;s deeply moving stories provide a fresh account of one of the most significant moments of political mobilization in American history.

Stretching north from New Orleans to the Canadian border and westward from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains, the area contained over 800,000 square miles. That same year, President Thomas Jefferson designated two young men &#x2014; Meriweather Lewis and William Clark &#x2014; as leaders of an expedition to explore this vast new acquisition, as well as other lands of the West.

Ticket") and fly away to visit the children's grandmother, who plays with them and tucks them into bed ("Buenas noches. Good night"). Each double-page spread offers a well-composed and nicely detailed scene for children to absorb, while the brief text introduces a couple of words or phrases in both Spanish and English.

The voice droned on mechanically as Peter Hallam sped through the lobby of Center City Hospital, never stopping to answer the page since the team already knew he was on his way. He furrowed his brow as he pressed six, his mind already totally engaged with the data he had been given twenty minutes before on the phone. They had waited weeks for this donor, and it was almost too late. Almost. His mind raced as the elevator doors ground open, and he walked quickly to the nurses' station marked Cardiac Intensive Care.<br> <br> "Have they sent Sally Block upstairs yet?" A nurse looked up, seeming to snap to attention as her eyes met his. Something inside her always leapt a little when she saw him. There was something infinitely impressive about the man, tall, slender, gray- haired, blue-eyed, soft-spoken. He had the looks of the doctors one read about in women's novels. There was something so basically kind and gentle about him, and yet something powerful as well. The aura of a highly trained racehorse always straining at the reins, aching to go faster, farther...to do more...to fight time...to conquer odds beyond hope...to steal back just one life...one man...one woman...one child...one more. And often he won. Often. But not always. And that irked him. More than that, it pained him. It was the cause for the lines beside his eyes, the sorrow one saw deep within him. It wasn't enough that he wrought miracles almost daily. He wanted more than that, better odds, he wanted to save them all, and there was no way he could.<br> <br> "Yes, Doctor." The nurse nodded quickly. "She just went up."<br> <br> "Was she ready?" That was the other thing about him and the nurse marveled at the question. She knew instantly what he meant by "ready"; not the I.V. in the patient's arm, or the mild sedative administered before she left her room to be wheeled to surgery. He was questioning what she was thinking, feeling, who had spoken to her, who went with her. He wanted each of them to know what they were facing, how hard the team would work, how much they cared, how desperately they would all try to save each life. He wanted each patient to be ready to enter the battle with him. "If they don't believe they have a fighting chance when they go in there, we've lost them right from the beginning," the nurse had heard him tell his students, and he meant it. He fought with every fiber of his being, and it cost him, but it was worth it. The results he'd gotten in the past five years were amazing, with few exceptions. Exceptions which mattered deeply to Peter Hallam. Everything did. He was remarkable and intense and brilliant...and so goddamn handsome, the nurse reminded herself with a smile as he hurried past her to a small elevator in the corridor behind her. It sped up one floor and deposited him outside the operating rooms where he and his team performed bypasses and transplants and occasionally more ordinary cardiac surgery, but not often. Most of the time, Peter Hallam and his team did the big stuff, as they would tonight.<br> <br> Sally Block was a twenty-two- year-old girl who had lived most of her adult life as an invalid, crippled by rheumatic fever as a child, and she had suffered through multiple valve replacements and a decade of medication. He and his associates had agreed weeks before when she'd been admitted to Center City that a transplant was the only answer for her. But thus far, there had been no donor. Until tonight, at two thirty in the morning, when a group of juvenile delinquents had engaged in their own private drag races in the San Fernando Valley; three of them had died on impact, and after a series of businesslike phone calls from the splendidly run organization for the location and placement of donors, Peter Hallam knew he had a good one. He had had calls out to every hospital in Southern California for a donor for Sally, and now they had one&#x2013;if Sally could just survive the surgery, and her body didn't sabotage them by rejecting the new heart they gave her.<br> <br> He peeled off his street clothes without ceremony, donned the limp green cotton surgery pajamas, scrubbed intensely, and was gowned and masked by surgical assistants. Three other doctors and two residents did likewise as did a fleet of nurses. But Peter Hallam seemed not even to see them, as he walked into the operating room. His eyes immediately sought Sally, lying silent and still on the operating-room table, her own eyes seemingly mesmerized by the bright lights above her. Even lying there in the sterile garb with her long blond hair tucked into a green cotton cap she looked pretty. She was not only a beautiful young woman but a decent human being as well. She wanted desperately to be an artist...to go to college...to go to a prom...to be kissed...to have babies.... She recognized him even with the cap and mask and she smiled sleepily through a haze of medication.<br> <br> "Hi." She looked frail, her eyes enormous in the fragile face, like a broken china doll, waiting for him to repair her.<br> <br> "Hello, Sally. How're you feeling?"<br> <br> "Funny." Her eyes fluttered for a moment and she smiled at the familiar eyes. She had come to know him in the last few weeks, better than she had known anyone in years. He had opened doors of hope to her, of tenderness, and of caring, and the loneliness and isolation she had felt for years had finally seemed less acute to her.<br> <br> "We're going to be pretty busy for the next few hours. All you have to do is lie there and snooze." He watched her and glanced at the monitors nearby before looking back at her again. "Scared?"<br> <br> "Sort of." But he knew she was well prepared. He had spent weeks explaining the surgery to her, the intricate process, and the dangers and medications afterward. She knew what to expect now, and their big moment had come. It was almost like giving birth. And he would be giving birth to her, almost as though she would spring from his very soul, from his fingertips as they fought to save her.<br> <br> The anesthetist moved closer to her head and searched Peter Hallam's eyes. He nodded slowly and then smiled at Sally again. "See you in a little while." Except it wouldn't be a little while. It would be more like five or six hours before she was conscious again, and then only barely, as they watched her in the recovery room, before moving her to intensive care.<br> <br> "Will you be there when I wake up?" A frown of fear creased her brows and he was quick to nod.<br> <br> "I sure will. I'll be right there with you when you wake up. Just like I'm here with you now." He nodded to the anesthetist then, and her eyes fluttered closed briefly from the sedative they had administered before. The sodium pentothal was administered through the intravenous tube already implanted in her arm; a moment later, Sally Block was asleep, and within minutes, the delicate surgery began.<br> <br> For the next four hours, Peter Hallam worked relentlessly to hook up the new heart, and there was a wondrous look of victory on his face, as it began to pump. For just a fraction of a second, his eyes met those of the nurse standing across from him, and beneath the mask he smiled. "There she goes." But they had only won the first round, he knew only too well. It remained to be seen if Sally's body would accept or reject the new heart. And as with all transplant patients, the odds weren't great. But they were better than they would have been if she hadn't had the surgery at all. In her case, as with the other people he operated on, it was her only hope.<br> <br> At nine fifteen that morning, Sally Block was wheeled into the recovery room, and Peter Hallam took his first break since four thirty A.M. It would be a while before the anesthetic wore off, and he had time for a cup of coffee, and a few moments of his own thoughts. Transplants like Sally's drained everything from him.<br> <br> "That was spectacular, Doctor." A young resident stood next to him, still in awe, as Peter poured himself a cup of black coffee and turned to the young man.<br> <br> "Thank you." Peter smiled, thinking how much the young resident looked like his own son. It would have pleased him no end if Mark had had ambitions in medicine, but Mark already had other plans, business school, or law. He wanted to be part of a broader world than this, and he had seen over the years how much his father had given of himself and what it had cost him emotionally each time one of his transplant patients died. That wasn't for him. Peter narrowed his eyes as he took a sip of the inky brew, thinking that maybe it was just as well. And then he turned to the young resident again.<br> <br> "Is this the first transplant you've seen?"<br> <br> "The second. You performed the other one too." And performed somehow seemed the appropriate word. Both transplants had been the most theatrical kind of surgery the young man had witnessed. There was more tension and drama in the operating room than he had ever experienced in his life, and watching Peter Hallam operate was like watching Nijinsky dance. He was the best there was. "How do you think this one will do?"<br> <br> "It's too soon to tell. Hopefully, she'll do fine." And he prayed that what he said was true, as he covered his operating-room garb with another sterile gown and headed toward the recovery room. He left his coffee outside, and went to sit quietly in one of the chairs near where Sally lay. A recovery-room nurse and a battery of monitors were watching Sally's every breath, and so far all was well. The trouble, if it arose, was likely to come later than this, unless of course everything went wrong from the beginning. And that had happened before too. But not this time...not this time...please God...not now...not to her...she's so young...not that he would have felt any differently if she had been fifty- five instead of twenty-two.<br> <br> It hadn't made any difference when he lost his wife. He sat looking at Sally now, trying not to see a different face...a different time...and yet he always did...saw her as she had been in those last hours, beyond fighting, beyond hope...beyond him. She hadn't even let him try. No matter what he said, or how hard he had tried to convince her. They had had a donor. But she had refused it. He had pounded the wall in her room that night, and driven home on the freeway at a hundred and fifteen. And when they picked him up for speeding, he didn't give a damn. He didn't care about anything then...except her...and what she wouldn't let him do. He had been so vague when the highway patrol stopped him that they made him get out of the car and walk a straight line. But he wasn't drunk, he was numb with pain. They had let him go with a citation and a stiff fine, and he had gone home to wander through the house, thinking of her, aching for her, needing all that she'd had to give, and would give no more. He wondered if he could bear living without her. Even the children seemed remote to him then...all he could think of was Anne. She had been so strong for so long, and because of her he had grown over the years. She filled him with a kind of strength he drew on constantly, as well as his own skill. And suddenly that wasn't there. He had sat terrified that night, alone and frightened, like a small child, and then suddenly at dawn, he had felt an irresistible pull. He had to go back to her...had to hold her once more...had to tell her the things he had never said before...He had raced back to the hospital again and quietly slipped into her room, where he dismissed the nurse and watched her himself, gently holding her hand, and smoothing the fair hair back from her pale brow. She looked like a very fragile porcelain doll, and once just before morning burst into the room, she opened her eyes...<br> <br> "...Peter..." Her voice was less than a whisper in the stillness.<br> <br> "I love you, Anne..." His eyes had filled with tears and he had wanted to shout, "Don't go." She smiled the magical smile that always filled his heart, and then with the ease of a sigh she was gone, as he stood in bereft horror and stared. Why wouldn't she fight? Why wouldn't she let him try? Why couldn't he accept what other people accepted from him every day? But he couldn't accept it now. He stood and he stared at her, sobbing softly, until one of his colleagues led him away. They had taken him home and put him to bed, and somehow in the next days and weeks he had gone through all the motions that were expected of him. But it was like an ugly underwater dream, and he only surfaced now and then, until at last he realized how desperately his children needed him.<br> <br> And slowly, he had come back, and three weeks later he was back at work, but there was something missing now. Something that meant everything to him. And that something was Anne. She never left his mind for very long. She was there a thousand times a day, as he left for work, as he walked in and out of patients' rooms, as he walked into surgery, or back out to his car in the late afternoon. And when he reached his front door, it was like a knife in his heart again every time he went home, knowing that she wouldn't be there.<br> <br> It had been over a year now, and the pain was dimmer, but not yet gone. And he somehow suspected that it never would be. All he could do was continue with his work, give everything he could to the people who turned to him for help...and then of course there were Matthew, Mark, and Pam. Thank God, he had them. Without them he would never have survived. But he had. He had come this far, and he would live on...but so differently...without Anne...<br> <br> He sat in the stillness of the recovery room, his long legs stretched out before him, his face tense, watching Sally breathe, and at last her eyes opened for an instant and fuzzily swept the room.<br> <br> "Sally...Sally, it's Peter Hallam...I'm here, and you're fine..." For now. But he didn't say that to her, nor did he even let himself think that. She was alive. She had done well. She was going to live. He was going to do everything in his power to see to it.<br> <br> He sat at her bedside for another hour, watching her, and speaking to her whenever she came around, and he even won a small, weak smile from her before he left her shortly after one in the afternoon. He stopped in the cafeteria for a sandwich, and went back to his office briefly, before coming back to the hospital to see patients at four o'clock, and at five thirty he was on the freeway on his way home, his mind once again filled with Anne. It was still difficult to believe that she wouldn't be there when he got home. When does one stop expecting to see her again, he had asked a friend six months before. When will I finally understand it? The pain he had come to know in the past year and a half had etched a certain vulnerability into his face. It hadn't been there before, that visible hurt of loss and sorrow and pain. There had only been strength there before, and confidence, the certainty that nothing can ever go wrong. He had three perfect children, the perfect wife, a career he had mastered as few men do. He had climbed to the top, not brutally but beautifully, and he loved it there. And now what? Where was there left to go, and with whom?</p><h2>Surrender of a Siren: A Novel (Wanton Dairymaid Trilogy)</h2><p><b>New author Tessa Dare takes passion to the high seas in this steamy tale of a runaway bride and a devilishly disarming privateer.</b><br><br> Desperate to escape a loveless marriage and society&#x2019;s constraints, pampered heiress Sophia Hathaway jilts her groom, packs up her paints and sketchbook, and assumes a new identity, posing as a governess to secure passage on the Aphrodite.

She makes her home in Southern California, where she shares a cozy, cluttered bungalow with her husband, their two children, and a dog.<i>Chapter One&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Gravesend, December 1817&nbsp;</i><br>In fleeing the society wedding of the year, Sophia Hathaway&nbsp;knew she would be embracing infamy.&nbsp;<br><br>She&#x2019;d neglected to consider how infamy <i>smelled</i>.&nbsp;She paused in the doorway of the fetid dockside tavern.&nbsp;Even from here, the stench of soured ale accosted&nbsp;her, forcing bile into her throat.&nbsp;<br><br>A burly man elbowed her aside as he went out the&nbsp;door. &#x201c;Watch yerself, luv.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>She pasted herself against the doorjamb, wondering at&nbsp;the singular form of address implied in &#x201c;luv.&#x201d; The man&#x2019;s&nbsp;comment had clearly been directed toward <i>both </i>of her&nbsp;breasts.&nbsp;<br><br>With a shiver, she wrapped her cloak tight across her&nbsp;chest.&nbsp;<br><br>Taking one last deep breath, she sidled her way into&nbsp;the dank, drunken confusion, forbidding her gray serge&nbsp;skirts to brush against anything. Much less any<i>one</i>. From&nbsp;every murky corner&#x2013; and for a squared- off tea caddy of a&nbsp;building, this tavern abounded in murky corners&#x2013; eyes&nbsp;followed her. Suspicious, leering eyes, set in hard, unshaven&nbsp;faces. It was enough to make any young woman&nbsp;anxious. For a fugitive young lady of quality, traveling&nbsp;alone, under the flimsy shield of a borrowed cloak and a&nbsp;fabricated identity . . .&nbsp;<br><br>Well, it was almost enough to make Sophia reconsider&nbsp;the whole affair.&nbsp;<br><br>An unseen someone jostled her from behind. Her&nbsp;gloved fingers instinctively clutched the envelope secreted&nbsp;in her cloak. She thought of its brethren, the letters&nbsp;she&#x2019;d posted just that morning, breaking her engagement&nbsp;and ensuring a scandal of Byronic proportions. Seeds of&nbsp;irrevocable ruin, scattered with the wind.&nbsp;<br><br>A cold sense of destiny anchored her rising stomach.&nbsp;There was no going back now. She could walk through&nbsp;far worse than this shabby pub, if it meant leaving her&nbsp;restrictive life behind. She could even endure these coarse&nbsp;men ogling her breasts, so long as they did not glimpse&nbsp;the secret strapped between them.&nbsp;<br><br>Her resolve firmed, Sophia caught the eye of a baldheaded&nbsp;man wiping a table with a greasy rag. He looked&nbsp;harmless enough&#x2013; or at least, too old to strike quickly.&nbsp;She smiled at him. He returned the gesture with a completely&nbsp;toothless grin.&nbsp;<br><br>Her own smile faltering, she ventured, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking&nbsp;for Captain Grayson.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Course you is. All the comely ones are.&#x201d; The gleaming&nbsp;pate jerked. &#x201c;Gray&#x2019;s in the back.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>She followed the direction indicated, moving through&nbsp;the crowd on tiptoe in an effort to keep her hem off the&nbsp;floor. The sticky floorboards sucked at her half boots.&nbsp;Toward the back of the room, she spied a boisterous knot&nbsp;of men and women near the bar. One man stood taller&nbsp;than the others, his auburn hair looking cleaner than that&nbsp;of his company. A brushed felt beaver rested on the bar&nbsp;nearby, an oddly refined ornament for this seedy den.&nbsp;As Sophia angled for a better view, a chair slid out&nbsp;from a nearby table, clipping her in the knee. She bobbled&nbsp;on tiptoe for a moment before tripping forward.&nbsp;<br><br>The hem of her cloak caught on her boot, and the cloak&nbsp;wrenched open, exposing her chest and throat to the<i>&nbsp;</i>sour, wintry air. In her desperate attempt to right herself,&nbsp;she clutched wildly for the wall&#x2013;&nbsp;<br><br>And grasped a handful of rough linen shirt instead.&nbsp;The shirt&#x2019;s own er turned to her. &#x201c;Hullo there, chicken,&#x201d;&nbsp;he slurred, his breath rancid with decay. His liquorglazed&nbsp;eyes slid over her body and settled on the swell of&nbsp;her breasts. &#x201c;Fancy bit of goods you are. By looks, I&nbsp;would have priced you beyond my pocket, but if you&#x2019;s&nbsp;offerin&#x2019; . . .&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Had he mistaken her for some dockside trollop?&nbsp;<br><br>Sophia&#x2019;s tongue curled with disgust. Perhaps she was disguised&nbsp;in simple garments, but certainly she did not look&nbsp;<i>cheap</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I am not offering,&#x201d; she said firmly. She tried to wriggle&nbsp;away, but with a quick move, he had her pinned&nbsp;against the bar.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Hold there, lovely. Jes&#x2019; a little tickle, then.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>His grimy fingers dove into the valley of her bosom,&nbsp;and Sophia yelped. &#x201c;Unhand me, you . . . you revolting&nbsp;brute!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The brute released one of her arms to further his lascivious&nbsp;exploration, and Sophia used her newly freed&nbsp;hand to beat him about the head. No use. His fingers&nbsp;squirmed between her breasts like fat, greedy worms&nbsp;burrowing in the dark.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Stop this,&#x201d; she cried, making her hand a fist and&nbsp;clouting his ear, to no avail. Her efforts at defense only&nbsp;amused her drunken attacker.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;S&#x2019;all right,&#x201d; he said, chuckling. &#x201c;I likes my girls with&nbsp;plenty o&#x2019; pluck.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Desperation clawed at her insides. It wasn&#x2019;t simply the&nbsp;insult of this lout&#x2019;s hands on her breasts that had her panicking.&nbsp;She&#x2019;d forfeited her genteel reputation the moment&nbsp;she left home. But his fingers groped closer and closer to&nbsp;the one thing she dared not surrender. If he found it,&nbsp;Sophia doubted she would escape this tavern with her&nbsp;life intact, much less her virtue.&nbsp;<br><br>Her attacker turned his head, angling for a better&nbsp;look down her dress. His grimy ear was just inches from&nbsp;her mouth. Within snapping distance. If she bit it hard&nbsp;enough, she might startle him into letting her go. She&nbsp;had all but made up her mind to do it, when she inhaled&nbsp;another mouthful of his rank sweat and paused. If her&nbsp;choices were putting her mouth on this repulsive beast&nbsp;or dying, she just might rather die.&nbsp;<br><br>In the end, she didn&#x2019;t do either.&nbsp;<br><br>The repulsive beast gave a yawp of surprise as a pair&nbsp;of massive hands bodily hauled him away. Lifted him,&nbsp;actually, as though the brute weighed nothing, until he&nbsp;writhed in the air above her like a fish on a hook.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Come now, Bains,&#x201d; said a smooth, confident baritone,&nbsp;&#x201c;you know better than that.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>With an easy motion, her rescuer tossed Bains aside.&nbsp;The brute landed some feet away, with the crunch of&nbsp;splintering wood.&nbsp;<br><br>Sagging against the bar with relief, Sophia peered up&nbsp;at her savior. It was the tall, auburn- haired gentleman&nbsp;she&#x2019;d spied earlier. At least, she assumed him to be a gentleman.&nbsp;His accent bespoke education, and with his&nbsp;dark- green topcoat, fawn- colored trousers, and tasseled&nbsp;Hessians, he cut a fashionable silhouette. But as his arms&nbsp;flexed, the finely tailored clothing delineated raw, muscled&nbsp;power beneath.&nbsp;<br><br>And there was nothing refined about his face. His features&nbsp;were rough- hewn, his skin bronzed by the sun. It&nbsp;was impossible not to stare at the golden, weathered hue&nbsp;and wonder&#x2013; did it fade at his cravat? At his waist? Not&nbsp;at all?&nbsp;<br><br>The more she peered up at the man, the less she knew<i>&nbsp;</i>what to make of him. He had a gentleman&#x2019;s attire, a laborer&#x2019;s&nbsp;body . . . and the wide, sensuous mouth of a&nbsp;scoundrel.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;How many times do I have to tell you, Bains? That&#x2019;s&nbsp;no way to touch a woman.&#x201d; His words were addressed&nbsp;to the lout on the floor, but his ro guish gaze was fixed on&nbsp;her. Then he smiled, and the lazy quirk of his lips tugged&nbsp;a thin scar slanting from his jaw to his mouth.&nbsp;<br><br>Oh yes, that mouth was dangerous indeed.&nbsp;<br><br>At that moment, Sophia could have kissed it.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;The proper way to touch a woman,&#x201d; he continued,&nbsp;sauntering to her side and propping an elbow on the bar,&nbsp;&#x201c;is to come at her from the side, like so.&#x201d; In an attitude&nbsp;of perfect nonchalance, he leaned his weight on his arm&nbsp;and slid it along the bar until his knuckles came within&nbsp;a hair&#x2019;s width of her breast.&nbsp;<br><br>Mouth of a scoundrel, indeed! Sophia&#x2019;s gratitude&nbsp;quickly turned to indignation. Had this man truly yanked&nbsp;one lout off her just so he could grope her himself? Apparently&nbsp;so. His hand rested so close to her breast, her&nbsp;flesh heated in the shadow of his fingers. So close, her&nbsp;skin prickled, anticipating the rough texture of his&nbsp;touch. She wished he <i>would </i>touch her, end the excru -&nbsp;ciating uncertainty, and give her an excuse to slap the&nbsp;ro guish smirk from his face.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;See?&#x201d; he said, waggling his fingers in the vicinity of&nbsp;her bosom. &#x201c;This way you don&#x2019;t startle her off.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Coarse laughter rumbled through the assembled crowd.&nbsp;Retracting his hand, the scoundrel lifted his voice.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t I have the right of it, Megs?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>All eyes turned to a curvy redhead gathering tankards.&nbsp;Megs barely looked up from her work as she sang out,&nbsp;&#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t no one like Gray knows how to touch a lady.&#x201d;&nbsp;Laughter swept the tavern again, louder this time.&nbsp;Even Bains chuckled.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Gray</i>. Sophia&#x2019;s heart plummeted. What was it the bald&nbsp;man had said, when she asked for Captain Grayson?&nbsp;<i>Gray&#x2019;s in the back.&nbsp;<br><br></i>&#x201c;One last thing to remember, Bains,&#x201d; Gray continued.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;The least you can do is buy the lady a drink.&#x201d; As the&nbsp;tavern- goers returned to their carousing, he turned his&nbsp;arrogant grin on Sophia. &#x201c;What are you having, then?&#x201d;&nbsp;She blinked at him.&nbsp;<br><br><i>What was she having? </i>Sophia knew exactly what she&nbsp;was having. She was having colossally bad luck.&nbsp;<br><br>This well- dressed mountain of insolence looming over&nbsp;her was Captain Grayson, of the brig <i>Aphrodite</i>. And the&nbsp;brig <i>Aphrodite </i>was the sole ship bound for Tortola until&nbsp;next week. For Sophia, next week might as well have&nbsp;been next year. She needed to leave for Tortola. She&nbsp;needed to leave now. Therefore, she needed this man&#x2013;&nbsp;or rather, this man&#x2019;s <i>ship</i>&#x2013; to take her.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;What, no outpouring of gratitude?&#x201d; He cast a glance&nbsp;toward Bains, who was lumbering up from the floor. &#x201c;I&nbsp;suppose you think I should have beat him to a pulp. I&nbsp;could have. But then, I don&#x2019;t like violence. It always ends&nbsp;up costing me money. And pretty thing that you are&#x201d;&#x2013;&nbsp;his eyes skipped over her as he motioned to the barkeep&#x2013;&nbsp;&#x201c;before I went to that much effort, I think I&#x2019;d at least&nbsp;need to know your name, Miss . . . ?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Sophia gritted her teeth, marshalling all her available&nbsp;forbearance. She needed to leave, she reminded herself.&nbsp;She needed this man. &#x201c;Turner. Miss Jane Turner.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Miss . . . Jane . . . Turner.&#x201d; He teased the syllables&nbsp;out, as if tasting them on his tongue. Sophia had always&nbsp;thought her middle name to be the dullest, plainest syllable&nbsp;imaginable. But from his lips, even &#x201c;Jane&#x201d; sounded&nbsp;indecent.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, Miss <i>Jane </i>Turner. What are you drinking?&#x201d;<i>&nbsp;<br><br></i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not drinking anything. I&#x2019;m looking for you, <i>Captain&nbsp;</i>Grayson. I&#x2019;ve come seeking passage on your ship.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;On the <i>Aphrodite</i>? To Tortola? Why the dev il would&nbsp;you want to go there?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a governess. I&#x2019;m to be employed, near Road&nbsp;Town.&#x201d; The lies rolled effortlessly off her tongue. As always.&nbsp;His eyes swept her from bonnet to half boots, stroking&nbsp;an unwelcome shiver down to her toes. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t&nbsp;look like any governess I&#x2019;ve ever seen.&#x201d; His gaze settled&nbsp;on her hands, and Sophia quickly balled them into&nbsp;fists.&nbsp;<br><br><i>The gloves. </i>Curse her vanity. Her maid&#x2019;s old dress and&nbsp;cloak served well for disguise&#x2013; their dark, shapeless&nbsp;folds could hide a multitude of sins. But as she&#x2019;d dressed&nbsp;herself for the first time in her life that morning, her fingers&nbsp;shook with nerves and cold, and Sophia had assuaged&nbsp;their trembling with this one indulgence, her best&nbsp;pair of black kid gloves, fastened with tiny black pearl&nbsp;buttons and lined with sable.&nbsp;<br><br>They were not the gloves of a governess.&nbsp;<br><br>For a moment, Sophia feared he would see the truth.&nbsp;Balderdash, she chided herself. No one ever looked at&nbsp;her and saw the truth. People saw what they wanted to&nbsp;see . . . the obedient daughter, the innocent maiden, the&nbsp;society belle, the blushing bride. This merchant captain&nbsp;was no different. He would see a passenger, and the&nbsp;promise of coin.&nbsp;<br><br>Long ago, she&#x2019;d learned this key to deceit. It was easy&nbsp;to lie, once you understood that no one really wanted&nbsp;the truth.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Lovely, aren&#x2019;t they? They were a gift.&#x201d; With a gloved&nbsp;flourish, she held out her letter. The envelope bore the&nbsp;wear and marks of a transatlantic voyage. &#x201c;My offer of&nbsp;employment, if you&#x2019;d care to examine it.&#x201d; She sent up a&nbsp;quick prayer that he would not. &#x201c;From a Mr. Waltham&nbsp;of Eleanora plantation.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Waltham?&#x201d; He laughed, waving away the letter.&nbsp;Sophia pocketed it quickly.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Miss Turner, you&#x2019;ve no idea what trials you&#x2019;re facing.&nbsp;Never mind the dangers of an ocean crossing, the&nbsp;tropical poverty and disease . . . George Waltham&#x2019;s brats&nbsp;are a plague upon the earth. One your delicate nature&nbsp;and fine gloves are unlikely to survive.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You know the family, then?&#x201d; Sophia kept her tone&nbsp;light, but inwardly she loosed a flurry of curses. She&#x2019;d&nbsp;never considered the possibility that this merchant captain&nbsp;could claim an acquaintance with the Walthams.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I know Waltham,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;We grew up&nbsp;together. Our fathers&#x2019; plantations shared a boundary.&nbsp;<br><br>He was older by several years, but I paced him for mischief&nbsp;well enough.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Sophia swallowed a groan. Captain Grayson not only&nbsp;<i>knew </i>Mr. Waltham&#x2013; they were friends and neighbors!&nbsp;All her plans, all her carefully tiered lies . . . this bit of&nbsp;information shuffled them like a deck of cards.&nbsp;<br><br>He continued, &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re traveling alone, with no&nbsp;chaperone?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I can look after myself.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, yes. And I tossed Bains across the room just now&nbsp;for my own amusement. It&#x2019;s a little game we seamen like&nbsp;to play.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I can look after myself,&#x201d; she insisted. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d waited&nbsp;another moment, that revolting beast would be missing&nbsp;an ear.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>He gave her a deep, scrutinizing look that made her&nbsp;feel like a turned- out glove, all seams and raw edges. She&nbsp;breathed steadily, fighting the blush creeping up her&nbsp;cheeks.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Miss Turner,&#x201d; he said dryly, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m certain in that fertile<i>&nbsp;</i>female imagination of yours, you think sailing off to the&nbsp;West Indies will be some grand, romantic adventure.&#x201d;&nbsp;He drawled the phrase in a patronizing tone, but Sophia&nbsp;wasn&#x2019;t certain he meant to deride <i>her</i>. Rather, she surmised,&nbsp;his tone communicated a general weariness with&nbsp;adventure.&nbsp;<br><br>How sad.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Fortunately,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never known a girl&nbsp;I couldn&#x2019;t disillusion, so listen close to me now.

Broder, chief political reporter and columnist, Washington Post</p></p><h2>Sophie Calle: The Address Book</h2><p><i>The Address Book</i>, a key and controversial work in Sophie Calle's oeuvre, lies at the epicenter of many layers of reality and fiction. Having found a lost address book on the street in Paris, Calle copied the pages before returning it anonymously to its owner. She then embarked on a search to come to know this stranger by contacting listed individuals--in essence, following him through the map of his acquaintances. Originally published as a serial in the newspaper <i>Lib�ration</i> over the course of one month, her incisive written accounts with friends, family and colleagues, juxtaposed with photographs, yield vivid subjective impressions of the address book's owner, Pierre D., while also suggesting ever more complicated stories as information is parsed and withheld by the people she encounters. Collaged through a multitude of details--from the banal to the luminous, this fragile and strangely intimate portrait of Pierre D. is a prism through which to see the desire for, and the elusivity of, knowledge. Upon learning of this work and its publication in the newspaper, Pierre D. expressed his anger, and Calle agreed not to republish the work until after his death. Until then, <i>The Address Book</i> had only been described in English--as the work of the character Maria Turner, whom Paul Auster based on Calle in his novel <i>Leviathan</i>; and in <i>Double Game</i>, Calle's monograph which converses with Auster's novel. This is the first trade publication in English of <i>The Address Book</i> (Gemini G.E.L. in Los Angeles released a suite of lithographs modeled on the original tabloid pages from <i>Lib�ration</i> in an edition of 24). The book has the physical weight and feel of an actual address book with a new design of text and images which allow the story to unfold and be savored by the reader.</p><p>A remarkably poignant and tender portrait of a man she would never meet. (Mary Kaye Schilling <i>T Magazine</i>)<br><br>The Address Book is never about one thing. One the one hand it is a simple character study and straightforward conceptual art project (task-based with a priori scheme, black-and-white documentation, and text). On the other, it&#x2019;s an unsettling confessional story with deeply erotic subject matter. It unnerves readers by striking a balance between submission and control, winding them through a maze of seduction and pursuit only to leave them deprived of fulfillment. (Lauren O'Neill-Butler <i>LA Review of Books</i>)<br><br>Given the ease with which we can access the lives of strangers in 2012, Calle's snooping might register as a quaint trespass from another era, an analog and ultimately harmless kind of proto-Facebooking. But her old-school sleuthing is daring, more so than it was in her earlier projects, such as Suite venitienne, in which Calle followed strangers, and La Filature, for which she hired a detective to tail her. The Address Book's adventure is riskier and more unpredictable.

Anyone familiar with Russo&#x2019;s&nbsp;novels&nbsp;will recognize Gloversville&#x2014;once famous for producing nine out of ten dress gloves in the United States. By the time Rick was born, ladies had stopped wearing gloves and Gloversville was on its way out. Jean Russo instilled in her son her dream of a better life elsewhere, a dream that prompted her to follow him across the country when he went to college. Their adventures and tribulations on that road trip were a preview of the hold his mother would continue to have on him as she kept trying desperately to change her life. Recounted with a clear-eyed mix of regret, nostalgia, and love, <i>Elsewhere</i> is a stirring tribute to the tenacious grip of the past.</p></p><p>Richard Russo is the author of eight novels; two collections of stories; and<i> Elsewhere, </i>a memoir. In 2002 he received the Pulitzer Prize for <i>Empire Falls,</i> which like <i>Nobody&#x2019;s Fool </i>was adapted to film, in a multiple-award-winning HBO miniseries.<p><b>Prologue<br><br></b>A few years ago, passing the sign on the New York State Thruway for the Central Leatherstocking Region, a friend of mine misread it as saying <i>laughingstock</i> and thought, That must be where Russo&#x2019;s from. She was right. I&#x2019;m from Gloversville, just a few miles north in the foothills of the Adirondacks, a place that&#x2019;s easy to joke about unless you live there, as some of my family still do.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town wasn&#x2019;t always a joke. In its heyday, nine out of ten dress gloves in the United States were manufactured there. By the end of the nineteenth century, craftsmen from all over Europe had flocked in, for decades producing gloves on a par with the finest made anywhere in the world. Back then glove-cutting was governed by a guild, and you typically apprenticed, as my maternal grandfather did, for two or three years. The primary tools of a trained glove-cutter&#x2019;s trade were his eye, his experience of animal skins, and his imagination. It was my grandfather who gave me my first lessons in art&#x2014;though I doubt he would&#x2019;ve worded it like that&#x2014;when he explained the challenge of making something truly fine and beautiful from an imperfect hide. After they&#x2019;re tanned but before they go to the cutter, skins are rolled and brushed and finished to ensure smooth uniformity, but inevitably they retain some of nature&#x2019;s imperfections. The true craftsman, he gave me to understand, works around these flaws or figures out how to incorporate them into the glove&#x2019;s natural folds or stitching. Each skin posed problems whose resolution required creativity. The glove-cutter&#x2019;s job wasn&#x2019;t just to get as many gloves as possible out of a hide but to do so while minimizing its flaws.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leather had been tanned in Fulton County, using the bark of hemlock trees, since before the American Revolution. Gloversville and neighboring Johnstown were home not only to gloves but to all things leather: shoes and coats and handbags and upholstery. My paternal grandfather, from Salerno, Italy, having heard about this place where so many artisans had gathered, journeyed to upstate New York in hopes of making a living there as a shoemaker. From New York City he took the train north to Albany, then west as far as the Barge Canal hamlet of Fonda, where he followed the freight tracks north up to Johnstown, where I was born decades later. Did he have any real idea of where he was headed, or what his new life would be like? You tell me. Among the few material possessions he brought with him from the old country was an opera cape.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both men had wretched timing. My father&#x2019;s father soon learned that Fulton County wasn&#x2019;t Manhattan or even Salerno, and that few men in his new home would buy expensive custom-made shoes instead of cheaper machine-made ones, so he had little choice but to become a shoe repairman. And by the time my mother&#x2019;s father arrived in Gloversville from Vermont, the real craft of glove-cutting was already under assault. By the end of World War I, many gloves were being &#x201c;pattern cut.&#x201d; (For a size 6 glove, a size 6 pattern was affixed to the skin and cut around with shears.) Once he returned from World War II, the process was largely mechanized by &#x201c;clicker-cutting&#x201d; machines that quickly stamped out presized gloves, requiring the operator only to position the tanned skin under the machine&#x2019;s lethal blades and pull down on its mechanical arm. I was born in 1949, by which time there wasn&#x2019;t much demand for handmade gloves or shoes, but both my grandfathers had long since made their big moves to Fulton County and staked their dubious claims. By then they had families, and so there they remained. It was also during the fi rst half of the twentieth century that chrome tanning, a chemical procedure that made leather more supple and water resistant, and dramatically sped up the whole process, became the industry standard, replacing traditional vegetable tanning and making tanneries even more hazardous, not just for workers but also for those who lived nearby and, especially, downstream. Speed, efficiency, and technology had trumped art and craft, not to mention public safety.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, between 1890 and 1950 people in Gloversville made good money, some of them a lot of it. Drive along Kingsboro Avenue, which parallels Main Street, and have a gander at the fine old houses set back from the street and well apart from one another, and you&#x2019;ll get a sense of the prosperity that at least the fortunate ones enjoyed until World War II. Even downtown Gloversville, which by the 1970s had become a Dresdenlike ruin, still shows signs of that wealth. The Andrew Carnegie Gloversville Free Library is as lovely as can be, and the old high school, which sits atop a gentle hill, bespeaks a community that believed both in itself and that good times would not be fleeting. On its sloping lawn stands a statue of Lucius Nathan Littauer, one of the richest men in the county, whose extended arm appears to point at the grand marble edifice of the nearby Eccentric Club, which refused him membership because he was a Jew. Down the street is the recently restored Glove Theatre, where I spent just about every Saturday afternoon of my adolescence. There was also a charming old hotel, the Kingsboro, in whose elegant dining room Monsignor Kreugler, whom I&#x2019;d served as an altar boy at Sacred Heart Church, held weekly court after his last Sunday Mass. Once it was razed, visitors had to stay in nearby Johnstown, out on the arterial highway that was supposed to breathe new life into Gloversville but instead, all too predictably, allowed people to race by, without stopping or even slowing down, en route to Saratoga, Lake George, or Montreal.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How quickly it all happened. In the Fifties, on a Saturday afternoon, the streets downtown would be gridlocked with cars honking hellos at pedestrians. The sidewalks were so jammed with shoppers that, as a boy trapped among taller adults, I had to depend on my mother, herself no giant, to navigate us from one store to the next or, more harrowingly, across Main Street. Often, when we finished what we called our weekly &#x201c;errands,&#x201d; my mother and I would stop in at Pedrick&#x2019;s. Located next to city hall, it was a dark, cool place, the only establishment of my youth that was air-conditioned, with a long, thin wall whose service window allowed sodas and cocktails to be passed from the often raucous bar into the more respectable restaurant. Back then Pedrick&#x2019;s was always mobbed, even in the middle of a Saturday afternoon. Mounted on the wall of each booth was a minijukebox whose movable mechanical pages were full of song listings. Selections made here&#x2014;five for a quarter, if memory serves&#x2014;were played on the real jukebox on the far wall. We always played a whole quarter&#x2019;s worth while nursing sodas served so cold they made my teeth hurt. Sometimes, though, the music was drowned out by rowdy male laughter from the bar, where the wall-mounted television was tuned to a Yankees ball game, and if anybody hit a home run everyone in the restaurant knew it immediately. I remember listening intently to all the men&#x2019;s voices, trying to pick out my father&#x2019;s. He and my mother had separated when I was little, but he was still around town, and I always imagined him on the other side of that wall in Pedrick&#x2019;s.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also suspected that my mother, if she hadn&#x2019;t been saddled with me, would have preferred to be over there herself. She liked men, liked being among them, and on the restaurant side it was mostly women and kids and older people. Though I couldn&#x2019;t have put it into words, I had the distinct impression that the wall separating respectability from fun was very thin indeed. There was another jukebox in the bar, and sometimes it got cranked up loud enough to compete with whatever was playing on ours, and then my mother would say it was time to go, as if she feared the wall itself might come crashing down. To her, music getting pumped up like that could only mean one thing: that people were dancing, middle of the afternoon or not, and if she&#x2019;d been over there, she would&#x2019;ve been as well. A good decade after the end of World War II, Gloversville was still in a party mode, and regular Saturday<br>festivities routinely continued right up to last call and often beyond, the town&#x2019;s prosperous citizens dancing and drinking at the Eccentric Club, the more middle-class folk in the blue-collar taverns along upper Main Street or, in summer, at the pavilion at nearby Caroga Lake, the poor (often the most recent immigrants with the lowest-paying tannery jobs) in the gin mills bordering South Main in the section of town referred to as &#x201c;the Gut,&#x201d; where arrests for drunkenness or indecency or belligerence were much more likely to be recorded in the local newspaper on Monday than comparable exploits at the Eccentric Club.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time I graduated from high school in 1967, you could have strafed Main Street with an automatic weapon without endangering a soul. On Saturday afternoons the sidewalks were deserted, people in newly reduced circumstances shopping for bargains at the cheap, off-brand stores that had sprung up along the arterial. The marquee at the Glove Theatre bore the title of the last film to play there, though enough of the letters were missing that you couldn&#x2019;t guess what it was. Jobless men emerged from the pool hall or one of the seedy gin mills that sold cheap draft beer and rotgut rye, blinking into the afternoon light and fl exing at the knees. Lighting up a smoke, they&#x2019;d peer up Main Street in one direction, then down the other, as if wondering where the hell everybody went. By then the restaurant side of Pedrick&#x2019;s had closed, but since I turned eighteen that summer, now of legal drinking age, the other side was no longer off-limits. Now, though, it was quiet as a library. The Yankees were still playing on the television, but Mantle and Maris and Yogi and Whitey Ford had all retired, and their glory days, like Gloversville&#x2019;s, were over. The half-dozen grizzled, solitary drinkers rotated on their stools when the door opened, like the past might saunter in out of the bright glare trailing ten-dollar bills in its wake. Every now and then that summer of &#x2019;67, I&#x2019;d poke my head into Pedrick&#x2019;s to see if my father was among those drinking Utica Club drafts at the bar. But, like time itself, he, too, had moved on.<br>What happened? Lots of things. After World War II, about when men stopped wearing hats, women stopped wearing gloves. Jackie Kennedy did wear a pair at her husband&#x2019;s inauguration, and that turned the clock back for a while, but the trend proved irreversible. More important, glove making started going overseas where labor was cheap. Gloversville went bust the way Mike Campbell declares his bankruptcy in Hemingway&#x2019;s <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>, &#x201c;gradually and then suddenly.&#x201d; The &#x201c;giant sucking sound&#x201d; of globalism arrived decades early and with a vengeance. My maternal grandfather, who, despite being a veteran of two world wars, had been branded a Communist from the pulpit of Sacred Heart Church for being a union man, saw it coming even before crappy Asian-made gloves showed up in the shops, where a few buttons could be sewn on and the gloves stamped MADE IN GLOVERSVILLE. Around Thanksgiving, the trade&#x2019;s off-season, workers in the skin mills got laid off, and every year it took a little longer for them to be called back. Worse, they weren&#x2019;t all rehired at once, which practice allowed the shop owners to remind their employees that things were different now. What mattered was moving inventory down the line, not quality. After all, Asians and Indians were doing what the local stiffs did for a quarter of the cost.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grandfather, who came home from the Pacific with malaria and soon afterward developed emphysema, was by then too sick to fight. He continued to work as always, refusing to cut corners and, as a result, making considerably less money than men for whom slapdash was good enough. The bosses could exploit him, give him the most flawed skins, and treat him like a robot instead of the craftsman he was, but he claimed the one thing they couldn&#x2019;t order him to do was a bad job. But of course they didn&#x2019;t need to. You only had to look at how his narrow, concave chest heaved as he struggled to draw oxygen into his failing lungs to know he wouldn&#x2019;t be anybody&#x2019;s problem much longer. His wife, who&#x2019;d also survived the Depression, foresaw a diminished future. She began stocking the pantry with cans of wax beans and tuna fish earlier every year, aware that the layoffs would run even longer, and her husband, growing sicker by the day, would be among the last called back. Jesus on his best day could do no more with loaves and fishes than my grandmother did with a pound of bacon. Still, it was just a matter of time.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of which had much effect on me. As a boy I was happy as a clam in Gloversville. My mother and I shared a modest two-family house on Helwig Street with her parents. They lived in the two-bedroom, single-bath downstairs flat, my mother and I in the identically configured one above. My grandfather, who&#x2019;d never before purchased anything he couldn&#x2019;t pay for with cash out of his wallet, bought the house, I suspect, because he knew his daughter&#x2019;s marriage was on the rocks and that she and I would need a place to live. Our block of Helwig Street was neighborly, with a corner grocery store situated diagonally across the street. My mother&#x2019;s sister and her family lived around the corner on Sixth Avenue, which meant I grew up surrounded by cousins. In kindergarten and first grade, my grandmother walked me to school in the morning and was there to meet me in the afternoon, and in the summer we took walks to a lovely little park a few blocks away. On weekends it was often my grandfather who&#x2019;d take my hand, and together we&#x2019;d head downtown for a bag of &#x201c;peatles,&#x201d; his peculiar word for red-skinned peanuts, stopping on the way back to visit with friends sitting out on their porches. By the time I was old enough to get my first bike and explore beyond Helwig Street, I&#x2019;d discovered the magic of baseball, and so, wooden bat over my shoulder, mitt dangling from my handle-bars, I disappeared with friends for whole mornings or afternoons or both. At my aunt&#x2019;s there was a hoop over the garage, and during the long winters my cousin Greg and I kept the driveway shoveled meticulously so we could shoot baskets, even when it was so cold the net froze and you couldn&#x2019;t dribble the ball. Come autumn I raked leaves, stealing this job from my grandfather, who loved to do it, though he didn&#x2019;t always have sufficient breath. Sometimes he&#x2019;d start the job, and I&#x2019;d finish while he snuck a cigarette around back of the house where my grandmother couldn&#x2019;t see him. Summers I mowed lawns, and winters I shoveled sidewalks. An American childhood, as lived in the Fifties by a lower-middle class that seems barely to exist anymore, in a town that seemed unexceptional then, and not, as it seems to me now, the canary in the mine shaft.<br>What follows in this memoir&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know what else to call it&#x2014;is a story of intersections: of place and time, of private and public, of linked destinies and flawed devotion. It&#x2019;s more my mother&#x2019;s story than mine, but it&#x2019;s mine, too, because until just a few years ago she was seldom...</p></p><h2>The River of Heaven: The Haiku of Basho, Buson, Issa, and Shiki</h2><p>Known to many as the study of quiet stillness and introspection, Zen Buddhism distinguishes itself through brilliant flashes of insight and its terseness of expression. In <i>River of Heaven</i> these concepts and pillars lend themselves to an exploration of Haiku, one of the most delicate and interpretive poetic forms in the world. The haiku verse form, with its rigid structure and organic description is a superb means of studying Zen modes of thought because its seventeen syllables impose a limitation that confines the poet to vital experience. In Haiku as in Buddhism, the silences are as expressive as the words.<br><br>In this volume, American Senior Zen Roshi Robert Aitken gives new insight into Haiku by poetic masters Basho, Issa, Buson, and Shiki. In presenting themes from Haiku and from Zen literature, Aitken illuminates the relationship between the two. Readers are certain to find this an invaluable and enjoyable experience for the remarkable revelation it offers.<br></p><p>Robert Aitken was the author of more than a dozen books about Buddhism, including A Zen Wave, Encouraging Words, and Taking the Path of Zen.

There are Douglas firs as tall as skyscrapers, and a banyan tree in Calcutta as big as a football field.<br><br> From the tallest to the smallest, trees inspire wonder in all of us, and in <i>The Tree,</i> Colin Tudge travels around the world&#x2014;throughout the United States, the Costa Rican rain forest, Panama and Brazil, India, New Zealand, China, and most of Europe&#x2014;bringing to life stories and facts about the trees around us: how they grow old, how they eat and reproduce, how they talk to one another (and they do), and why they came to exist in the first place. He considers the pitfalls of being tall; the things that trees produce, from nuts and rubber to wood; and even the complicated debt that we as humans owe them.<br><br> Tudge takes us to the Amazon in flood, when the water is deep enough to submerge the forest entirely and fish feed on fruit while river dolphins race through the canopy. He explains the &#x201c;memory&#x201d; of a tree: how those that have been shaken by wind grow thicker and sturdier, while those attacked by pests grow smaller leaves the following year; and reveals how it is that the same trees found in the United States are also native to China (but not Europe).<br><br> From tiny saplings to centuries-old redwoods and desert palms, from the backyards of the American heartland to the rain forests of the Amazon and the bamboo forests, Colin Tudge takes the reader on a journey through history and illuminates our ever-present but often ignored companions.</p><p><b>COLIN TUDGE</b> started his first tree nursery in his garden at the age of eleven.

It&#x2019;s the way to get to the heart of things. Children ask ridiculously simple questions&#x2014;like &#x201c;Who made God?&#x201d;&#x2014;that have kept theologians busy for many a century. In such a vein we might innocently inquire, &#x201c;And what, pray, are trees, that anyone should presume to write a book about them?&#x201d; And &#x201c;Why do plants grow into trees?&#x201d; And &#x201c;How many kinds are there?&#x201d; Childish stuff, but it will serve to mark out the ground.<br>What Is a Tree?<br>A tree is a big plant with a stick up the middle.<br>Everybody knows that. But that statement as it stands requires what modern philosophers would call a little &#x201c;deconstruction.&#x201d;<br>What, for a start, is meant by &#x201c;big&#x201d;? It&#x2019;s a relative term, of course, although if we choose we can put a figure on it&#x2014;say, a minimum height of five or six meters. There is a case for doing this: if you are a forester, or are running a nursery, you need some guidelines. But guidelines are not definitions. They are ways of helping practical people do practical things. They do not&#x2014;and are not intended to&#x2014;capture what Aristotle would have called the essence of nature.<br>For many trees grow big when conditions are favorable, and stay small when they are not. An oak is a noble tree in a forest or a park, but an acorn that falls in a fissure in some Scottish crag may spend a couple of centuries in bonsai mode, never more than a twisted stick. Yet it may turn out acorns that, if they should be carried to some fertile field, could again produce magnificence. Is the twisted stick less of an oak because it fell on stony ground? And if it remains an oak, is it not still a tree? Then again&#x2014;a different kind of case&#x2014;the world&#x2019;s many kinds of birches form the genus Betula. None are as huge as an oak may often be, but most are perfectly respectable trees. Yet there is one, Betula nana, that is adapted to the tundra of the north of Scotland and mainland Europe and is very small indeed. Do we say that all birches are trees except for the tough little Betula nana? Or do we say it&#x2019;s a dwarf tree?<br>What of the stick that runs up the middle, the &#x201c;trunk,&#x201d; which holds the &#x201c;crown&#x201d; of the tree aloft? Should there be just one, a solitary pillar, or are several allowed? Many a gardener and forester has insisted that plants with a lot of supporting sticks should be called shrubs. Again, for practical purposes such distinctions can be useful. If Alice&#x2019;s Queen of Hearts had instructed her long-suffering gardeners to plant her an arboretum and they&#x2019;d come up with a shrubbery, their heads would surely have come off. But wild nature is not so easily pinned down. In the Cerrado of Brazil&#x2014;the vast, dry forest, about the size of France, in the middle of the country to the south and east of Amazonia&#x2019;s rain forest&#x2014;there are trees that form bona fide, big, one-trunked trees when they grow along the banks of the occasional rivers but become multistemmed, short shrubs where it&#x2019;s drier. The shrub is not merely stunted, like the oak in the rock. It is a discrete life-form. Many organisms exhibit what biologists call &#x201c;polymorphism,&#x201d; meaning &#x201c;many forms.&#x201d; Many kinds of fish, for example, have dwarf forms and full-size forms; some butterflies and snails are highly variable. Here we see a polymorphic tree&#x2014;one form for the forest, another for the open ground.<br>Then again, many big trees, including some cedars, many a mulberry, and the beautiful blue-flowered jacaranda, may grow from ground level with several solid trunks of equal magnitude. Each may be as big as a respectable oak. Are they trees or big shrubs? The family of the heathers, Ericaceae, also includes the rhododendrons from the Himalayas and the madrone trees of the United States, with their beautiful flaky, yellow, pink, and gray trunks (which add yet more color to the already wondrous hills of California). Rhododendrons tend to have many stems, while madrones are commonly content with one. But the rhododendrons can be just as big and solidly wooden as the madrones. In nature, in short, trees and shrubs are not distinct. Why should they be? Nature was not designed to make life easy for biologists.<br>Must the central stick be of wood? That, after all, is what we generally mean by &#x201c;stick.&#x201d; How, then, should we categorize banana plants? In general shape they resemble palm trees, with a thick central stem and a whorl of huge leaves at the top. But the stem of the banana plant is not made of wood. Its stem is formed largely from the stalks of the leaves, and its strength comes from fibers that are not bound together, as in pines or oaks or eucalypts, to form true timber; its hardness is reinforced, as in a cabbage stalk, by the pressure of water in the stem. So botanically the banana plant is a giant herb. But it looks like a tree and competes with trees on their own terms, as a big plant seeking the light (although, like the trees of cacao and tea and coffee, the banana prefers a little shade).<br>In fact, there are many lineages of trees&#x2014;quite separate evolutionary lines that have nothing to do with one another except that they are all plants. Many plants, in many of those lineages, have independently essayed the form of the tree. Each achieves treedom in its own way. &#x201c;Tree&#x201d; is not a distinct category, like &#x201c;dog&#x201d; or &#x201c;horse.&#x201d; It is just a way of being a plant. The different kinds have much in common, and it is good and necessary to have some feel for what is essential. But the essences of nature will not be pinned down easily. In the end, all definitions of nature are simply for convenience, helping us focus on the particular aspect that we happen to be thinking about at the time. There is no phenomenon in all of nature&#x2014;whether it&#x2019;s as simple as &#x201c;leg&#x201d; or &#x201c;stomach&#x201d; or &#x201c;leaf&#x201d; or more obviously conceptual like &#x201c;gene&#x201d; or &#x201c;species&#x201d;&#x2014;that does not take a variety of forms, and that cannot be looked at from an infinite number of angles; and each angle gives rise to its own definition. A horse cannot be encapsulated, as Charles Dickens&#x2019;s Thomas Gradgrind insisted in Hard Times, as &#x201c;a graminivorous quadruped.&#x201d; There is more to horses than that. The way we define natural things influences the way we treat them&#x2014;whether we speak of wildflowers or of weeds, of Mrs. Tittlemouse or of vermin. But in the end nature is as nature is, and we must just try with different degrees of feebleness, and for our own purposes, to make what sense of it we can.<br>For the purposes of this book, the child&#x2019;s definition of &#x201c;tree&#x201d; will serve&#x2014;albeit with slight elaboration: &#x201c;A tree is a big plant with a stick up the middle&#x2014;or could be, if it grew in the right circumstances; or is very closely related to other plants that are big and have a stick up the middle; or resembles a big plant with a stick up the middle.&#x201d; It is clumsy, but it will have to do. So to the next childish question.<br>Why Be a Tree?<br>A nonliving thing is passive. The atoms of which a stone is composed sit there for as long as it endures&#x2014;until it is melted in some volcano, or dissolved by acid rain. But living things are restless, through and through. As soon as some living cell has constructed some protein, as part of its own fabric, it starts to dismantle it again. This constant self-renewal, powered by an endless intake of energy, is called metabolism.<br>Metabolism&#x2014;the basic business of staying alive&#x2014;is half of what living things do. The other half is reproduction. It is not vital to reproduce in order to stay alive. Indeed, reproduction involves sacrifice; reproduction, as we will see later in this book, is often the last fling: many a tree dies after one bout of it. But it is essential nonetheless. At least, all creatures that do not reproduce die out. However successfully an organism may metabolize, sooner or later time and chance will finish it off. Everything dies. Only those that reproduce endure&#x2014;or, at least, their offspring do. All individuals are part of lineages, offspring after offspring after offspring.<br>But then, too, each creature finds itself in the company of other creatures, of its own kind and of different kinds. To some extent they are its rivals, to some extent it needs them&#x2014;for food, shelter, mates, or whatever. Each successful creature, then&#x2014;each one that survives at all, that is&#x2014;must come to terms with the others around it.<br>All of life&#x2019;s requirements&#x2014;metabolism, reproduction, and the business of getting along with others&#x2014;are difficult. Each creature must solve life&#x2019;s problems in its own way. There is no perfect, universal life strategy. Each has its own advantages and drawbacks.<br>So it can pay a creature to be very small; or it can pay to be big. Each mode has its pros and cons. A plant that is big like a tree can stretch farther up into the sky, and so capture more of the sun&#x2019;s energy; and it can reach farther down into the earth, for water and minerals. This is the upside. But it takes a long time to achieve large size, and whether you are an oak tree or an elephant or a human being, the longer you take to develop the more likely you are to be killed before you reproduce.<br>Being big is difficult, too. To hold a ton of leaves aloft in the sun and air requires enormous strength: specialist material like wood, and clever architecture. All trees have wood, by definition (apart from those granted honorary status, like bananas); but as we will see, wood is subtle stuff, requiring much chemistry and microgeometry. The many types of trees have essayed many architectural forms. Ginkgoes and conifers are built from repeats of a single simple module: a straight trunk up the middle with circles or spirals of branches at intervals. In others, like the elm, the lead shoot bends over and the next shoot in line takes over the lead, until it too bends away and the one below that takes over. In yet others (particularly some tropical trees), the branches that grow upward from the horizontal branches repeat the form of the whole tree&#x2014;it&#x2019;s as if a new, miniature forest grew aloft, from the horizontal branches of the giants below. And still others, like oaks or chestnuts, are more free-flowing. There are many basic designs. The point is, though, that such design is necessary. Being big requires a lot of engineering as well as a lot of chemistry, and it takes a long time to put into place. But the bigger trees grow, the more they are vulnerable to wind&#x2014;and tropical storms regularly cut swaths as big as Los Angeles through the world&#x2019;s rain forests.<br>For the purposes of reproduction, most creatures pursue one of two main strategies. Some, known as K-strategists, produce just a few offspring at a time, which in general are large at the time of their birth to give them a good chance in life; after they are born, typically, the parents take good care of them. K-strategists tend to be long-lived and reproduce several times in their life, often at long intervals. Orangutans, elephants, eagles, and indeed human beings are classic&nbsp;K-strategists. Other creatures, known as r-strategists, produce an enormous number of offspring. Inevitably, each individual offspring is small, and so has little chance of survival. But there is safety in numbers. Codfish are noted r-strategists. They produce up to two million eggs at a time. The newly hatched fish live for a while as plankton, floating fairly helplessly&#x2014;and most perish: they just get eaten. But so long as each pair of codfish manage to produce just two surviving offspring in the course of their lives, the lineage of cod will carry on. Despite the enormous prodigality of their reproductive strategy, its fantastic wastefulness, codfish are immensely successful&#x2014;or at least they were until North Sea fishermen became too technically proficient, or too &#x201c;competitive,&#x201d; and disastrously reduced their numbers. Cod live a long time. But many r-strategists, like flies, run through their entire life cycle in a few weeks: birth, growth, reproduction, death. Thus populations of flies may rise and fall from near zero to plague proportions in what seems like no time at all.<br>Trees seem to get the best of both worlds. Many&#x2014;most&#x2014;produce huge numbers of seeds and may do so repeatedly. A mature oak or beech may produce many millions of seeds in a good year (good seed years are known as &#x201c;mast&#x201d; years), and although they won&#x2019;t do this every year, they may well have scores or even hundreds of prolific years in the course of their lives. They are r-strategists indeed, in a good year at least as prolific as codfish. Yet many trees&#x2014;including oaks&#x2014;produce seeds that are large and that do not need to germinate immediately: each has a very good chance of survival. To this extent they are K-strategists too. To combine the advantages of the K- and r-strategies an organism must be truly mighty. Yet there is a downside too: most trees must grow for several years, and many must endure for several decades, before they can reproduce at all; and all that time they are vulnerable.<br>We don&#x2019;t think of trees as r-strategists, because they are so big and long-lived. Their populations do not boom and bust like those of flies. They cannot, we imagine, leap to take advantage of newly created environments as a fly or a mouse may do. Yet once we venture beyond our own puny timescale and take the long view, we see that they can and do do this. Thus when the last ice age ended in the Northern Hemisphere, around ten thousand years ago, the forests of birches and alders that had been whiling away the time farther south were able virtually to race toward the North Pole in the wake of the retreating glaciers; and they will surely resume their advance as global warming reduces the polar ice still further. By the same token, the huge tropical rain forest of Queensland, in the Southern Hemisphere, has not been there forever, as it may seem. Like the Great Barrier Reef, which stands just off the Queensland coast and is as long from end to end as Great Britain, the rain forest of Australia grew up only after the last ice age and is a mere ten thousand years old. Macbeth was shocked to see the Great Wood of Birnam shift a few miles across the moor to the Hill of Dunsinane. But if we could take a time-lapse view of all the world this past few million or tens of millions of years, as cold has followed warm has followed cold, we would see vast and apparently immovable forests flitting over the surface of the globe like the shadows of clouds.</p>
